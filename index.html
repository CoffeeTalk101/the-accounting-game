<p id="calibre_link-1" class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">INTRODUCTION</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="1114115209" src="images/000186.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">H</span>ow do people really learn? The answers and theories are endless. They include ideas ranging from genetic imprinting to osmosis and modeling and emotional intelligence. Brain research is voluminous in the 21st century. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">For now, though, please ask yourself: How do I learn?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Isn’t that an interesting question? And, what do you learn? Do you learn information from reading, watching videos, using computers? Can you learn “people skills” without interacting with other people? Can you change behavior without a model of what the ideal behavior should look like? Feel like? Are there people you meet in your daily travels that you want to emulate? Do you emulate them? How does it work? Can you remember the words of the songs from childhood, but not the ones you listened to last week or even this morning? Questions and questions. More than any other thought process, questions help us learn. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Remember what we heard about a baby’s first year of life? Babies learn more in that year than in all the years combined afterwards. Yet, in that first year, babies cannot pose questions in the way they will once they learn language. So, how do babies learn? And what can we take away from that to help adults learn more quickly, retain new information longer, and apply it immediately in their lives? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, what does this have to do with you and this book? Good question.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">The Accounting Game </span>is written in a way that creates a specific learning experience for you as it teaches you the basic skills of accounting. We call the learning method accelerative learning. What do you think that means? It is a learning methodology that uses all of your senses as well as your emotions and your critical thinking skills. If you can remember your kindergarten or elementary school classrooms, you will see many colored maps, letters and numbers, bold (even raw) drawings by each child, etc. You learned the alphabet by singing. You learned the multiplication tables by saying them out loud with each other. You laughed a lot. You were creative. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Then, how you were taught began to change when you entered middle school or high school. Learning became more lecture, more black and white, more rote. You studied before tests and probably did well or maybe not. Yet, for all the endless homework and “cramming,” most of the information you learned in high school you don’t remember now. That’s because it went into your short-term memory so that you could pass the tests and move on to the next grade. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Yet, look at all the things you remember from early childhood! While in elementary school, much of the information you learned went directly to your long-term memory, because it was peppered with music, color, movement, smells, emotional experiences, and lots of play and fun. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The methodology we use in this book in many ways parallels how you learned in grade school. We do this by accessing the part of your brain where long-term memory lives. Now, the way to reach your long-term memory has to include emotion, because they reside in the same place in your brain&mdash;the limbic region. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The truth is, because of the way we humans learn, we have to discover something ourselves to really learn it. This book is designed so you make dozens of discoveries. In short, you will learn a college semester’s worth of accounting in the time it takes you to interact with this book. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">This is quite a reversal, because business people and students have over the years found the subject of accounting quite difficult to master. Many have simply given up in frustration, others have decided to leave accounting to the “experts.” This book is for all of you who have hated accounting, had difficulty learning it, or ever thought you didn’t really “get it.” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We think that most attempts to teach accounting fail because of too much attention to details and a failure to present the big picture framework of how it all works and fits together. In this book, we promise not to overburden you with details and to focus on what are really the key concepts of accounting that any businessperson needs to know. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You will learn the structure and purpose of the three primary financial statements&mdash;the balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash flow statement. You will learn how these fit together and their interrelationships. You will also learn the basic language of business&mdash;concepts like cost of goods sold, expenses, bad debts, accrual vs. cash methods of accounting, FIFO and LIFO, capitalizing vs. expensing, depreciation, and the difference between cash and profit. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Our promise is that you will get all this information in a fun and easy way that allows you to participate, interact, and discover all that you need to know. Many people need to have understanding and confidence in working with financial concepts, but are not ever going to be doing accounting details. If that is you, then this book fits that need, too. It is set up so that you can actually do financial statements as you are learning them. We invite you to “play the game” as you interact with this book (answers to the charts can be found in the Answer Key on pg. 159). </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Understanding all this information is nice, but what do you do with it? The final chapter will give you some tools for analyzing financial information and making better decisions for your company and your career. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">As mentioned, the information in this program was developed by Educational Discoveries, Inc. in the early 1980s in a one-day seminar, The Accounting Game. The program was originally created by Marshall Thurber at the Burklyn Business School in the late 1970s. Nancy Maresh, a student at Marshall’s school, then took the program and developed The Accounting Game seminar. We offer our heartfelt thanks for their original genius and commitment to bringing this extraordinary program to life. We also want to thank all of the somewhere between 75,000 and 100,000 people who have attended the public and private seminars for the fun they have been and for the insights and suggestions that have helped us improve the teaching of this information. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The Accounting Game is now offered in private seminars by Coastal Training Technologies Corporation. The Accounting Game continues to be the most successful financial seminar in the world. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, enjoy! Because if you enjoy this book, you’ll learn more in a brief time than you ever imagined possible.</span></p>

<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">R</span>emember how you learned to make money as a kid? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">There was baby-sitting and delivering newspapers. Shoveling snow off the neighbors’ sidewalk and driveway. Mowing lawns and taking care of other people’s pets and plants when they went on vacation. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">There is one business which, chances are, almost every kid tries at least once in his or her life. A tried and true operation as American as baseball and Mom’s apple pie. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The Lemonade Stand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">It’s this world of childhood, of lemonade stands and sunny days that we use in <span class="italic">The Accounting Game</span>. It’s hand-made signs and scraps of lumber turned into a humble yet proud establishment. It’s when saving up enough of your own money for a bike or a piece of sports equipment or horseback-riding lessons seemed the most important goal in the world. It’s when you had your first inkling about money, and wished you understood everything you needed to know about it. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now is your chance to go back, and learn what you need to know about the language of business, which goes by the name of Accounting.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, find a quiet space and relax. Read a paragraph of the italicized passage below, then close your eyes and visualize what you’ve just read. When you’re ready, go on to the next section, and the next... </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let yourself slowly go back in time... </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Let’s go back, all the way back to grade school. Picture yourself somewhere </span><span class="italic">between five to ten years old. Let yourself remember what your childhood grade </span><span class="italic">school looked like. If you went to more than one school, just pick out your favorite.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">It’s the last day of school. The sun is streaming through the classroom window.</span>
<span class="italic">You can’t wait for the final bell to ring one last time&mdash;then you’ll be free! Free to run </span><span class="italic">out the door with all your friends!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You’re young and safe and eager. Everything is possible. You feel creative, curious, </span><span class="italic">and excited, and know your success in life is absolutely assured.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let this picture settle into your mind. Take a deep breath. Enjoy it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">The final school bell rings. You tell your teacher to have a good summer, and you </span><span class="italic">rush out the door. It’s so warm and wonderful outside! The sky is blue and you look </span><span class="italic">up and see a few white, puffy, clouds decorating the view like a happy cartoon.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Kids are laughing. Lawnmowers are buzzing. Birds are chirping.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You can smell fresh cut grass and the scent of flowers.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You feel great.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You reach home and go inside. Since it’s a special day, your mom or dad is home </span><span class="italic">to meet you.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You’re hot and excited, so you say, “What’s to drink?”</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">And your mom or dad replies, “You’re in luck! I just bought some lemons and </span><span class="italic">some sugar so let’s make some fresh-squeezed lemonade.”</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You get out a great big pitcher, fill it with water and ice, squeeze up some lemons, </span><span class="italic">measure out the sugar, and mix up a batch of great tasting lemonade.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">This is going to be one fun summer!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Take a moment and let this thought settle. Take a deep breath.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You take your drink outside and sit under your favorite tree. The lemonade tastes </span><span class="italic">out of this world!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Then it hits you&mdash;people will pay good money for lemonade like this!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">Ready? Good!</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">In the garage is the stuff you need to make a lemonade stand: two wooden fruit crates turned on their ends, some old cans of paint and brushes, a hammer and some nails. You take an hour or two to put your stand together. It’s fun working with your hands and watching something of your own devising take shape. When you finish, you take a close look at your new place of business. If there’s a finer lemonade stand in the world, you sure haven’t seen it! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="1114115501" src="images/000100.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Here’s your very own lemonade stand. Find some markers or stickers, and go ahead and decorate it, if you wish. Make it distinctively your own. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now that your place of business is ready, you need a product&mdash;and that takes money! You run to your bedroom and shake out all the quarters and nickels and dimes from your piggy bank. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">It adds up to FIVE DOLLARS!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You transfer the money to the closest equivalent you can find to a bulletproof, x-ray proof, robber proof, impossible-to-open safety deposit apparatus&mdash;an old cigar box your uncle was about to throw out. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You don’t want to mess with all those coins, so your mom or dad graciously exchanges all of them for five, crisp one-dollar bills. The five dollars go into the cigar box bank for safe-keeping. In case anyone doesn’t know the cigar box is off-limits, you take a marker and write on it: </span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">PRIVATE PROPERTY! </span><span class="bold">KEEP OUT(OR DIE)!</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay, your money is safe. What do we call those five one-dollar bills? <span class="bold">CASH!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And what color is cash? <span class="bold">Green!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now that you’re going to be rich, how are you going to keep track of the hundreds&mdash;no, millions! BILLIONS!&mdash;of dollars you’re going to make selling lemonade? You need some paper and a pencil, for sure. You need some way to keep a record of what money goes in and out of your business. This record keeping is what accounting is all about. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You know enough about the world to know that one way grownups keep track of numbers is to keep score&mdash;like in baseball or golf, or whether your mom or dad last cleaned up after the dog in the back yard. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You decide to create a scorecard for your business.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Your scorecard allows you to keep track of things happening in your business. To better understand how money flows in and out of a business, though, we need a scorecard that shows two things: WHAT WE HAVE and WHO OWNS IT. Which means we need to draw a line down the middle of the scorecard. On the left side you’ll track things and stuff you have and use in your business. On the right side you’ll track who owns that stuff. So, your scorecard looks like this: </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="1114115535" src="images/000139.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The left side represents WHAT WE HAVE.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The right side of our scoreboard represents WHO OWNS IT.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now that we have a proper scorecard, let’s back up a moment. You start the business with some Cash, specifically five dollars.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Who has it?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You’re right&mdash;you do! And, no doubt, you had to scrimp and save and keep your room clean and remind your parents a bunch of times to remember that the tooth fairy <span class="italic">always </span>leaves you some money when you lose a tooth. You worked hard for that five bucks! It’s yours and nobody else’s. Which means that it goes on the left side of the scorecard, as $5 in Cash. But it also goes on the right side since you own the $5. But what will you call this $5? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The whole idea is to invest the five bucks in your lemonade stand. Right?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, what should we call the money that you originally shook from the piggy bank to invest in the lemonade stand?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How about “ORIGINAL INVESTMENT”?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Who owns the Original Investment? You, as the owner, do. So it goes on the right side of our scorecard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s write in what’s happened, so far. Enter the five dollars in Cash on the left side and enter the five dollars in Original Investment on the right side. Next, enter the totals on the last line of each side. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="1114115560" src="images/000173.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Notice anything about the two sides?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">They’re equal. The left side equals the right side.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You now know an important rule about this financial scorecard. The left side will always, ALWAYS equal the right side!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Repeat this rule, please. Tape it to your forehead. Put it under your pillow at night, so you will remember it in your sleep:</span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">THE LEFT SIDE ALWAYS EQUALS </span><span class="bold">THE RIGHT SIDE!</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So far, so good. The weather is great outside and you’re ready to rock and roll! You can close your eyes and see the customers lining up around the block to sample your great tasting lemonade...until you realize that starting a lemonade stand will cost more than the original investment of five dollars because you have to buy stuff to make your lemonade. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Who is most kids’ personal banker?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Right, Mom and Dad.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So you go to one of them (you know which one is more likely to say yes), and you say, “Here’s your chance to teach me the real value of a dollar. Here’s your chance to invest in a business sure to make lots of money. Here’s your chance to help a budding billionaire. Here’s your chance to keep me out of your hair until dinnertime!” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">One of the reasons works, and Mom and Dad fork over TEN DOLLARS.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You’re halfway out the door when Mom calls, “Hey, that ten dollars isn’t a gift! It’s a loan!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You stop short. “A loan?” you repeat, making the word sound as disappointing as possible. “What’s the matter? Don’t you love me?” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Nice try,” Mom says. This is all part of teaching you something about the real world. Okay, you still have the money, even after Mom makes you sign a piece of paper that says “IOU” at the top. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Still, the ten dollars is yours to use, so you can add it to your Cash under What We Have.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But you also owe it to Mom. So, since you don’t, in fact, “own” the ten dollars, we need to create a new category on the right side (Who Owns It) of the scorecard. You have, in fact, just signed a “note” that is “payable” to your mom. Businesses have a name for an IOU. It’s called Notes Payable. Go ahead and record these transactions. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="1114115598" src="images/000013.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, we have the left side which represents what you have and use. And what do you have? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And how much cash so far? <span class="bold">Fifteen dollars.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Businesses have a name for the WHAT WE HAVE. Do you know it? <span class="bold">Assets.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, from now on, we’ll use Assets as our heading for the left side.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">On the right side, who owns that cash? You own five and your bankers (Mom and Dad) own how much? <span class="bold">Ten.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Since there are two owners on the right half, we will draw a horizontal line that divides the right side into two parts. The upper right side represents the people that the business owes money to...or to whom you are LIABLE. Are you going to have to pay back the ten dollars to Mom or Dad? (You’d better, if you want to see your next birth-day!) So, are you liable to them for $10? Yes. Which is why, from now on, we’ll label the top part of the right side, LIABILITIES. Notice we will use the color pink for liabilities. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The lower right side represents the portion of the business you own; right now, that is your Original Investment. What do some people call the part of the business owned by the owners? Make a check mark by the answer below. (Hint: there may be more than one answer.) </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><img alt="7129" src="images/000052.jpg" class="calibre3" />Equity </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><img alt="7129" src="images/000052.jpg" class="calibre3" />Owner’s Equity </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><img alt="7129" src="images/000052.jpg" class="calibre3" />Stockholders’ Equity </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><img alt="7129" src="images/000052.jpg" class="calibre3" />Net Worth </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did you make a check in front of all of the above? You should, because they’re all the same thing. For our sake, we’re going to call this lower right side, Owner’s Equity, and represent it with the color black. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, the right side has two parts: Liabilities (what you owe others) and Owner’s Equity (what’s yours).</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Remember we said the left side always equals the right side? Well, here’s the next accounting rule to remember:</span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s Equity</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Repeat this equation. Write it on the palm of your hand. Put it under a magnet on the fridge. Program it as your computer screensaver. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Here’s your scorecard again, with the proper accounting terms.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="1114115648" src="images/000162.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Before moving on&mdash;does the left side still equal the right side? <span class="bold">It should. Always!</span><span class="bold">Always! Always!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You’re doing great. And, hopefully, you’re having fun. You’re making discoveries, maybe seeing things clearly for the first time. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What’s a good way to capture such a beautiful moment? How about by taking a snapshot.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="1114115660" src="images/000000.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What period of time does a snapshot record? Check one:</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><img alt="7129" src="images/000052.jpg" class="calibre3" />A moment </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><img alt="7129" src="images/000052.jpg" class="calibre3" />Longer than a moment </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The answer is: A MOMENT. Snapshots give us an image of where we are right NOW. This scorecard is like a snapshot. It gives us an image, frozen at a particular moment, of a business’s financial position&mdash;what you have and where it came from. So, this scorecard shows a moment in time, and the two sides are equal&mdash;or, as they say, “in balance.” So, from now on, let’s call this scorecard... </span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">A BALANCE SHEET!</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But, for the moment, enough of this philosophical stuff about time and nitpicking over words&mdash;we’re here to start a lemonade stand! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Having the money to start your business, you tell your mom and dad that you’re biking to the store for supplies. The money in your pocket or pack feels enormous! You bike as fast as you can, so you can spend the money before you somehow lose it. Or before any robber is stupid enough to even try and catch you on your fleeting bike. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You make it to your neighborhood grocery store. It’s run by Mr. Pappy Parker, whom everyone calls “Pappy.” He has a large friendly face and a big nose. His eyes are blue, his eyebrows bushy gray. He’s bald and proud of it. Entering Pappy’s store, you feel like the happiest kid in the world. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You check your pocket or pack. The fifteen dollars is still there. Phe-ew! You take out the folded piece of paper on which (with your mom and dad’s help) you’ve written the supplies you need to open your lemonade stand. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">50 lemons </span><span class="bold">5 pounds of sugar </span><span class="bold">2 gallons of water</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The water you can get for free from your kitchen. The lemons and sugar you have to buy at Pappy’s store.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Lemons sell for twenty cents apiece. Sugar sells at forty cents per pound.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You’re pretty good at math, so go ahead and add up the cost of the goods you need to make lemonade:</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="1114115701" src="images/000042.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Having paid Pappy (who wishes you the best of luck with your new business), you load your supplies in your pack for the return trip. At home, you unload your supplies in the kitchen. Then, before you forget, you do a new scorecard that reflects the money spent buying goods to make your product. Since you spent twelve dollars on supplies, you need to take that amount out of Cash and record it somewhere new under Assets, since you’re now the proud owner of fifty lemons and five pounds of sugar. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What do business people call the raw materials used in producing a product? Here’s a hint. The word starts with “I” and ends with “Y.” Need another hint? The inside letters are “N-V-E-N-T-O-R.” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did you guess “Inventory”? If so, you’re absolutely right!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Inventory is a term for the raw materials, goods in process, and finished goods that a business plans to sell. Since you will use the lemons and sugar in your business, they are considered assets. So, Inventory is an Asset. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Take a moment and fill in the scorecard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="1114115715" src="images/000078.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Take at look at the last scorecard. Your cash is down, but it’s been converted into inventory. In other words, you exchanged one asset for another. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did this exchange change your total Assets? <span class="bold">No. Your total Assets remain at fifteen </span><span class="bold">dollars.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Was the right side of the scorecard affected by your trip to the store? <span class="bold">No. The </span><span class="bold">total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity remains at fifteen dollars.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Does the left side equal the right side? <span class="bold">Yes!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, you’re in balance!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">It’s time to make the lemonade.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Being careful not to waste a drop of lemon juice or a speck of sugar, being careful not to spill after you add the water, you discover that fifty lemons plus five pounds of sugar plus two gallons of water make enough lemonade to fill sixty glasses. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s put this into an equation, to determine what your COST OF PRODUCTION is.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="1114115743" src="images/000113.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now that we know your total Cost Of Production, let’s figure out the cost per glass, or UNIT COST:</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="1114115746" src="images/000151.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Hopefully, you came out with a Unit Cost of twenty cents. (Divide $12.00 by 60 glasses.)</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You now know that it costs you twenty cents to produce one glass of lemonade.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Not just a glass of ordinary lemonade, but, in your humble opinion, the world’s best glass of lemonade.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Then you ask yourself, “What will people pay for a glass of the world’s best lemonade?” You certainly need to charge more than it cost you, otherwise you won’t stay in business for long. But how much more? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You ask around. You ask your family and your friends and your neighbors and your dog or pet turtle. You think about what restaurants charge for drinks. You remember that last summer the kid down the street (who you don’t like) got a dollar for his lemonade which was made from some awful-tasting powder mix. Not surprisingly (and to your secret delight), he only made a few dollars, and only because his parents felt sorry for him and bought a few glasses which they barely choked down. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Your product is excellent. Still, you don’t want to charge so much as to scare away business. So, after concluding your research and pondering this important matter for a second or two, you decide to charge fifty cents a glass. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Finally, the big day arrives. The day your lemonade stand opens for business.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">It’s a warm, sunny, glorious day, full of promise, and there’s, like, hundreds of people out walking their dogs and riding bikes and doing chores. Best of all, they all look incredibly thirsty! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">In just a couple of hours, your cigar box starts to fill with quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies&mdash;and dollars! You can barely keep up with the demand. Your arm is about to fall off from pouring so many glasses of icy, cold, delicious, fresh, totally natural and organic lemonade, but you don’t care because business is so good! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">By the time you close up for the day, you’ve sold fifty&mdash;as in 5-0&mdash;glasses of lemonade! You add up all of the coins and dollars.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You sold twenty-five dollars of lemonade, on only your first day! Life doesn’t get much better than this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Then you remember that you had to spend money to make the lemonade. It cost 20 <img alt="7248" src="images/000187.jpg" class="calibre3" /> per glass, so it cost $10 to make 50 glasses. Now you figure if it cost $10 and you sold it for $25, you have $15 above and beyond your costs. Do you know what that’s called? <span class="bold">Profit or Earnings, right. </span>In order to figure out your earnings, you need to subtract the COST OF GOODS SOLD (what it cost to make the fifty glasses of lemonade you sold) from your SALES (the money brought in by selling lemonade). The result of this subtraction is what business people call GROSS PROFIT. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="1114115779" src="images/000028.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s reflect the day’s business on a scorecard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Remember, you sold fifty glasses of lemonade, which cost you ten dollars in Inventory to produce. Thus, the amount in Inventory was substantially reduced. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">In return, though, in came twenty-five dollars of Cash, representing the sales of fifty glasses. Go ahead and record these changes. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="1114115787" src="images/000066.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Does the left side equal the right side? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much more do you have on the left side than the right side? <span class="bold">Fifteen dollars.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Who owns that fifteen dollars? <span class="bold">You do.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So we add $15 to Owner’s Equity. But the earned $15 was not part of the Original Investment. So, what do you think we need to do? Yes, add another category to Owner’s Equity. We earned that $15, so we’re going to add EARNINGS WEEK TO DATE to the Owner’s Equity section. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Reflect your Earnings Week To Date on the right side of the next scorecard. Then add up the new total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, how much is on the left side? <span class="bold">Thirty dollars.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="1114115811" src="images/000101.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much is on the right side? <span class="bold">Thirty dollars.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Does the left side equal the right side? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What basic rule of accounting does this represent? <span class="bold">Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s </span><span class="bold">Equity.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">When did you earn that fifteen dollars? <span class="bold">Just now.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And, who do the earnings belong to? <span class="bold">Me, me, me!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Have things changed on your scorecard? <span class="bold">And how! </span>So, take another mental snapshot, one that records your first day running a lemonade stand&mdash;and making a profit! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">That evening, as you practically have the money you made already spent in your mind, Mom and Dad drop a bombshell.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Those glasses you used at your lemonade stand, the ones you handled so carefully and afterwards washed ’til they sparkled and returned to the cupboard without as much as a scratch or chip on them&mdash;the glasses you <span class="italic">borrowed </span>from the kitchen&mdash;guess what. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Mom and Dad want to give you a lesson about running a business, and, without warning, decide to charge you a GLASS RENTAL FEE of two dollars!! Talk about tough love! You keep your mouth shut, but secretly you’re convinced that Mom or Dad saw you making a profit and now want a piece of the action! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Worse yet, the next day, your best friend (or the kid you thought was your best friend) announces that he or she wants to be paid one dollar for a sign he or she painted for the lemonade stand. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Well, you decide, two can play this game! That afternoon, you decide you want to move the stand off your front yard, to the neighbors at the corner, which is sure to attract more business. Only problem is, the neighbors have been none too happy with you ever since they paid you to water their lawn while they were on vacation and you left the water on for about, oh, five hours too long and flooded their basement. But, hey, that was last summer, when you were just some silly kid. Now you’re a budding businessperson running your own enterprise. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Nervous as a cat in a dog kennel, you knock on the neighbors’ door. You explain your situation. To your relief, nobody mentions the flooded basement. They’re impressed with your initiative, and suggest a fair price for the use of their front yard. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now that you’re a real business person, with real sales and expenses, you pay the neighbors two dollars to rent a spot on their lawn. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Two dollars for glass rental. A dollar for advertising. Another two dollars to rent the location.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Stop and figure out your EXPENSES.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="1114115861" src="images/000140.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Expenses are the costs of doing business other than those related to producing your product. You have to pay these expenses, regardless of how much or how little lemonade you make or sell. Things like glass rental, advertising, rent, and other things not directly related to the cost of making your product are in this category. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You pay your expenses out of Cash. Record the change on the next scorecard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="1114115866" src="images/000174.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Does the left side equal the right side? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">In order to make both sides equal, you need to take five dollars off the right side. How about taking it out of the ten dollars you owe in Notes Payable? On second thought, the way Mom and Dad are acting, you might have to pay a finance charge for the original loan if you even broach the possibility! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What will the expenses reduce? <span class="bold">Expenses reduce earnings.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, you need to reduce your Earnings Week to Date by the amount you’ve incurred as Expenses in that period. Do so on the next score card. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="1114115882" src="images/000014.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, does the left side equal the right? <span class="bold">Yes!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Your cash is dropping but you still have enough left to pay off the ten-dollar IOU owed to Mom and Dad. You decide to do it, knowing your lemonade business will soon be challenging the likes of Nike, Disney, and Coca-Cola; even Microsoft! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You find the least wrinkled dollar bills and count out ten of them. Then you put them inside a card, which reads:</span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">Thanks for the loan! I love you!</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The card, in turn, goes into an envelope, which you seal and present to Mom and Dad.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">They open the envelope, read the card and pocket the ten bucks with a big smile. “You did good. We’re so proud of you!” They both give you a big hug. It’s a proud, proud day! They give you back the IOU, which you tear up. Life doesn’t get much better than this! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">To pay off the IOU, you took ten dollars from Cash. But it allows you to reduce to zero the amount owed to Notes Payable. Record this transaction on the next scorecard. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="1114115903" src="images/000053.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Does the left side equal the right side? <span class="bold">It does.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, what kind of scorecard is this? <span class="bold">A Balance Sheet.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And what does a balance sheet always have to do? <span class="bold">Balance.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s look at the purpose of a balance sheet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The left side is Assets. Assets as a word isn’t very kid-friendly. So, think of assets as THINGS AND STUFF.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="1114115920" src="images/000090.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The right side is Liabilities and Owner’s Equity. Some more not very kid-friendly words. Liabilities represents the people you owe money to. And Owner’s Equity is what you, as the owner of the business, own. Who owns things? Well, people, of course. So, think of the right side as PEOPLE. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Thus, the purpose of the Balance Sheet is to connect things to people. It shows you the things you have in your business. Then it connects the things you have to the people who own or have a claim on those things. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, go back and count how many Balance Sheets you filled out during this first week of your lemonade business. <span class="bold">A lot! Because you filled one out for each </span><span class="bold">transaction.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Would you normally fill out a Balance Sheet every single time you have a transaction? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How often a Balance Sheet is filled out varies from business to business. Banks, since they handle a great deal of money, do it on a daily basis. Some other businesses do it weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly. (A year is considered the basic accounting cycle.) </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Since you plan to continue selling lemonade through the summer, we will use a week as our accounting period and do balance sheets with each activity. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Boy, you’re doing great! But does a Balance Sheet tell you everything that happens in a business? <span class="bold">Look back at your last Balance Sheet.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What happened this week at your lemonade stand that isn’t recorded on the Balance Sheet?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Does the Balance Sheet show you what your sales were for the week? <span class="bold">No. </span>Does it tell you what the Cost of Goods Sold is? <span class="bold">Nope.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did you buy some inventory this week? <span class="bold">Yes. Remember the trip to the store for </span><span class="bold">supplies?</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did you sell some of your product? <span class="bold">Sure did!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Does the balance sheet tell you how much Inventory you bought and sold? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Does it tell you how much you paid for all your Expenses (like the glass rental, advertising, and rent for using the neighbors’ lawn)? <span class="bold">No way!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Does it tell you how you made your Earnings? <span class="bold">No. NO! And enough already with </span><span class="bold">these questions!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Would a business want to know all of these things? <span class="bold">You bet! </span>The problem is, you can’t find them by looking at a balance sheet. What will we need to do? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Create another scorecard.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We learned that a Balance Sheet shows us a moment in time, like a snapshot, but we need for our second scorecard to give us a record of events happening over a period of time. Events like buying inventory, making your product, selling it, and incurring expenses are happening over time. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What type of camera records a period of time? Something in the act of happening?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">A movie or video camera, of course.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, we need a financial scorecard that acts like a motion picture. It will cover a period of time and shows motion. It has a beginning and end, just like a movie or video. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Luckily, this second type of scorecard exists, and it goes by a number of names. Do any on this list sound familiar?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">Operating Statement.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">Income Statement.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">Profit &amp; Loss (or P &amp; L) Statement.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">All of these terms represent the same type of financial statement. But, for our purposes, let’s go with Income Statement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If you need a break&mdash;maybe all of this talk about lemonade has made you incredibly thirsty&mdash;now’s a good time. If you do take a break longer than a few minutes, you may want to review this section before moving ahead. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If, on the other hand, you have the stamina of a camel, next we’re going to take up the Income Statement.</span></p>
</div>  <div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><div class="calibre1">
<p id="calibre_link-4" class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">CHAPTER 2</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743750868" src="images/000127.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">I</span>magine how the first people to see motion pictures must have felt. Before the invention of the movies, the only way to capture the world was static&mdash;a frozen image, like a photograph or a painting. Then, with the first motion pictures, people were able to see the world as it really is! Always moving and changing. With things happening simultaneously at different places. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">At the end of the last chapter, we said that if the Balance Sheet is like a snapshot of a business, then the Income Statement is like a movie. Does a photograph have a beginning and an end? (No, unless you wish to enlist some strange philosophical argument that will bore even your best friend.) Now, does a movie have a beginning and an end? (You get two chances to answer, and the first one doesn’t count!) </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Thus, an Income Statement has a beginning and an end. Now, since we’re talking about a financial scorecard and not some zillion-dollar Hollywood extravaganza, what exactly does an income statement show us? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">It’s called an income statement, so let’s start by asking how income is generated in our lemonade business? From...what?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did you say, “Sales”? Very good!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743750853" src="images/000163.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, we begin with sales. Did it cost us any product to generate those sales? <span class="bold">Yes. </span>We need to find a name for what it costs us for goods sold. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Hmmmm. Any ideas out there?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Well, I’m going out on a limb now, but, with your permission, may I be bold enough to suggest Cost of Goods Sold?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, what does Cost of Goods Sold mean? The important thing is this: Cost of Goods Sold relates only to what? <span class="bold">Our product or our lemonade.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay, let’s do some figuring. If we subtract out the Cost of Goods Sold, not all the other stuff we spent money on, from Sales, what do we get? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Gross Profit.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Gross Profit is sales minus cost of goods sold. (Net Profit is something different, which we’ll get to shortly.)</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743750830" src="images/000001.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Why do we call it gross profit? The word “gross” in German means “big” or “fat,” so why is this the “fat profit”?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Because we haven’t taken out all the other costs of doing business.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And what are examples of some of the other costs of doing business?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did I hear someone say, “Expenses”? If so, you’re right!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Just to have our lemonade stand open out on the sidewalk did we have certain expenses? <span class="bold">Yes! </span>We had glass rental and rent to the neighbors for our location and some advertising. So, are Expenses the cost of being in business, regardless whether or not we sell a single glass of lemonade? <span class="bold">’Fraid so!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">A moment ago, we said the lemonade or the Cost of Goods Sold is subtracted from our Sales and then we’ve got our Gross Profit. Now, let’s subtract out all the other Expenses and we get what? (Now, those of us curious about Net Profit, chime in!) </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743750808" src="images/000043.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Notice how Net Profit is at the bottom line of this formula? So, it stands to reason that Net Profit is often called the...?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Bottom line.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You can see that our Income Statement separates costs into two categories&mdash;Cost of Goods Sold for all the costs of producing our product, and Expenses for all the non-production costs of running the business. For a business that does not have a tangible product (i.e., a service business) the two categories are Cost of Sales or Cost of Services and Expenses. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, go back to Chapter One and put in the numbers for the formula below, so we can see where we stand with the bottom line.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743750798" src="images/000079.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s take a moment and review.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The purpose of the Income Statement is to keep track of sales minus Cost of Goods Sold, which gives us Gross Profit. Then, we subtract all the other Expenses, which gives us our what? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Net Profit.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What is another name for net profit?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Net Income or the bottom line.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So&mdash;earnings, net profit, net income and the bottom line&mdash;are they all the same?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Absolutely!</span><span class="bold">
</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay, let’s get back to business! We’re going to go through a detailed Income Statement line by line. You may want to get a straight edge (a ruler; even an envelope or a piece of paper will do), to help you keep things clean and simple. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">INCOME STATEMENT</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743750773" src="images/000114.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We said that an Income Statement was like a motion picture in that it has a beginning and an end. This length of time can be a week, a month, a quarter of a year, etc. Whatever the length, it’s called the ACCOUNTING PERIOD. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Remember when you were a kid and how it was hard to look beyond the next day or two, much less well into the next week or month? Remember how agonizing it was to wake up early and have to wait and wait and wait and wait until your afternoon party guests started to arrive? So, since we’re running a lemonade stand, let’s not make our accounting period too long. Say, a week. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, let’s begin on Monday and end on Sunday. Wow, we’ve been in business one whole week! That’s longer than a lot of good ideas last. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Do you remember what our total sales were for the week?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">If not, check back in Chapter One.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Hopefully, you came up with twenty-five dollars in total Sales. Put it all the way to the right on the Income Statement. Why? Because it’s a total figure, and we’re going to do something with it in a little while. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">By the way, you probably notice that it’s pretty awkward to have to go back to look up all the information. Do you know how a business organizes the information so it is found easily? Businesses create what’s called a GENERAL LEDGER, which is a moment by moment record of every thing that happens. In the good old days of business, every entry in the General Ledger was recorded by hand. (Remember Scrooge poring over his ledger in <span class="italic">A Christmas Carol</span>?) Today, almost all businesses use a computer. The software is programmed to create categories for each item and sums them for the financial statements. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s drop down to the next line. What’s it say? <span class="bold">Beginning Inventory.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did we have any inventory before we started this week? <span class="bold">No. We didn’t even have </span><span class="bold">a business before this week!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So reason dictates that the amount of the Beginning Inventory is what? <span class="bold">Zero. </span>Go ahead and write it in. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Then, to start the business, you went and bought what? <span class="bold">Sugar for $2.00 and </span><span class="bold">Lemons for $10.00. </span>Write that in. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Drop down to the next line.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Given all this, how much available for sale did you have during the week? (Beginning Inventory + Purchases.) But did you sell it all? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Drop down to the next line.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What do we subtract out? <span class="bold">The lemonade not sold. </span>What’s it called? <span class="bold">Ending Inventory.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay, since we didn’t sell it, we can’t count it as a part of the Cost of Goods that we actually sold. Right? <span class="bold">Right.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Drop down to the next line.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Math time. Take Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory. The result is the actual Cost of Goods Sold. Which is...? (Write your answer on the Income Statement.) </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Write in the COGS. While you are doing it, notice that this figure is also where? <span class="bold">On the right.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Which means we’re going to do what with it?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Subtract it.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, subtract the Cost of Goods Sold from our Sales&mdash;and what do you have? (Write it in the next line, way to the right).</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What do we call this amount. <span class="bold">It’s our Gross Profit!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, what do have to subtract next? <span class="bold">Expenses.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Our Expenses include...what? <span class="bold">Well, there was Glass Rental and Advertising, and Rent. Go </span><span class="bold">back to Chapter One for the actual costs, then write them on your Income Statement.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What are your total Expenses? <span class="bold">Add up the Expenses.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Notice that this total figure goes where...? <span class="bold">All the way over on the right.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Which means we’re going to...? <span class="bold">Subtract it.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Subtract it from what? <span class="bold">The Gross Profit.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Which leave us with...? <span class="bold">Our Net Profit </span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">In what amount? (Write it down on the Income Statement.)</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Take a moment and wipe your brow and rest your racing pulse.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now compare the numbers on the Income Statement to the numbers on your last balance sheet that is on page 18. Do you see any numbers that are the same on the Balance Sheet and Income statement? <span class="bold">Earnings and Net Profit.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, are these two figures the same&mdash;Earnings week to date (on the balance sheet) and Net Profit (on the income statement)? <span class="bold">Yes!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">A while back we compared financial scorecards to snapshots and motion pictures. Let’s try looking at them in another way.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">A Balance Sheet is like the map of the state you live in. What do you see on a state map? (Cities, main roads, rivers, mountains, etc.) Basically, a pretty big picture short on details. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s focus on one item on the Balance Sheet: Earnings. Pretend it’s like the city or town you live in. The state map shows you where it is, but does not give you any details. What kind of map do you need to see the streets, the streams, the local landmarks? (A city or town map. ) It’s like a blow up and that’s what the Income Statement is. It’s a blow up or detailed “city map” of how we got to our Earnings. The Balance Sheet just says you had $10 in Earnings. The Income Statement shows that you had $25 in Sales, $10 in COGS, and $5 in Expenses. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Returning to the world of accounting, we take earnings week to date on the Balance Sheet and blow it up and what do we get?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">The Income Statement!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s look at the numbers on your last Balance Sheet in Chapter One and the Income Statement we just filled out on page 25.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743750629" src="images/000152.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743750628" src="images/000188.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Where, again, are the two financial statements related? <span class="bold">Net Profit and Earnings.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Any other number the same? YES! Inventory </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Why do you think our Ending Inventory is on the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement? <span class="bold">Because we haven’t used it!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We can’t take it as part of our Cost of Goods Sold because we haven’t sold it. So, we subtract it from our total available for sale. And on the Balance Sheet, since we haven’t sold it, does it have value? <span class="bold">Yes!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Is it something we can sell at another time? <span class="bold">Yes! </span>So, we leave it here in Ending Inventory. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So this is the end of the week, and what kind of Balance Sheet is this? <span class="bold">An Ending Balance Sheet.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And, if this is an Ending Balance Sheet, what kind of inventory is this? <span class="bold">Ending Inventory.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s just look at these two financial statements and how they’re linked together. We started with what kind of Balance Sheet on Monday? <span class="bold">A Beginning Balance Sheet.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And we ended on Sunday night with our what? <span class="bold">Ending Balance Sheet. </span>They give us two snapshots in time. Now, the truth is, we actually completed a bunch of Balance Sheets&mdash;one for each transaction. We will keep doing that throughout this book, but companies just generate a Beginning and Ending Balance Sheet at the start and end of their accounting period. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, at the start of this week, our beginning inventory was what? <span class="bold">ZERO. </span>And ending Inventory is what? <span class="bold">Two Dollars.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Our beginning Earnings are what? <span class="bold">Zero. </span>And our ending Earnings are what? <span class="bold">Ten Dollars.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The thing that connects the beginning and ending balance sheets is what? <span class="bold">The </span><span class="bold">movie or the Income Statement.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">It’s like this. The Beginning Balance Sheet shows us where we started, the Ending Balance Sheet shows us where we are, and what shows us how we got there? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">The Income Statement.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743750557" src="images/000029.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You’re doing great! Both as an entrepreneur and in understanding the basics of accounting.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Since you’re doing so great, here’s a little challenge. One item that occurred this week does not show up on our final Balance Sheet or on the Income Statement. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Here are three questions for you:</span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">What item is it?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">Why is it not on either statement?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">What does the absence of this item tell </span><span class="bold">us about our record keeping so far?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The answer to question one is, the loan payback to Mom and Dad. Why is that not on the Balance Sheet? Because it’s paid back. A loan only shows up on the Balance Sheet when you still owe it. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">To understand why it’s not on the Income Statement you have to ask yourself how you got the money. Did you earn it? <span class="bold">No. Your parents loaned it to you. </span>Did it really cost you anything to pay it back? <span class="bold">Not really, you just gave them back their </span><span class="bold">money after using it for a while. </span>So the principal of a loan, the actual amount borrowed, does not go on an Income Statement because you didn’t “earn it.” What would have affected Earnings? <span class="bold">Interest. Interest on the loan which would have shown </span><span class="bold">up as an expense. Thank goodness Mom and Dad didn’t think of that!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Getting to question three&mdash;what does this tell us about our records? <span class="bold">They are </span><span class="bold">incomplete.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Guess what, two financial statements do not present the whole picture! You need at least three statements. And what is the third one? (You probably already know, but just in case, what was affected both when you got and paid the loan? <span class="bold">Of course, </span><span class="bold">CASH FLOW. </span>So, the third statement keeps track of Cash Flow. We will develop it in detail in a later chapter.) </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Phew! It’s the end of the week. Want to work on Sunday? What? And miss a great day to relax, to hit the local swimming hole or pal around with friends? Let’s take Sunday off. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What are we going to do with those ten glasses of left over Inventory? Put it in the refrigerator and put a sign on it that says: </span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">For commercial use only!</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">Do not touch upon penalty of death!</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Time for a break.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Before you leave, give yourselves a gold star for doing such a good job your first week in the business. Good Job!</span></p>

<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743750493" src="images/000068.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">I</span>t’s Monday. A sunny morning, with the promise of getting really hot by noon. Which can mean but one thing to you, the budding beverage billionaire. It’s a great day to be selling lemonade! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Last week wasn’t bad, for a beginner. But from now on, well, look out world!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">First, let’s take a look at our last Balance Sheet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743750484" src="images/000103.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, this Balance Sheet is for which week? <span class="bold">Last week.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Therefore, it’s what kind of Balance Sheet? <span class="bold">Ending Balance Sheet.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, this is last week’s Ending Balance Sheet, and where is our ending Inventory? <span class="bold">In the refrigerator.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And now it’s Monday morning and you go and open up the refrigerator and what’s in there? <span class="bold">Your lemonade, or someone has some serious answering to do!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s say, for the sake of household peace, that, sure enough, your lemonade is still in the fridge. This Ending Inventory from last week becomes what kind of Inventory for this week? <span class="bold">Beginning Inventory, right!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">One last time: the ending Inventory automatically becomes what kind of Inventory? <span class="bold">Right! The Beginning Inventory for the next week.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The Ending Balance Sheet is for last week, so we need to make what kind of Balance Sheet for the beginning of week number 2? <span class="bold">Beginning Balance Sheet.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">There’s one more thing we need to do to convert last week’s Ending Balance Sheet to this week’s Beginning Balance Sheet. Do you know what that is? <span class="bold">The earnings.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The earnings we have were good for which week?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Last week, the first week of our business. </span>As a result, these earnings are now what? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">History.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What are earnings that are history, or earnings from past accounting periods called? <span class="bold">Retained Earnings.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Yes, Retained Earnings, and we need to make room for our earnings for when? <span class="bold">This week.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We’re going to take these earnings from last week and roll them up into a new category called Retained Earnings, making room for this week’s earnings. We will do this to a sing-along so everyone sing to the tune of “Roll Out The Barrels.” Ready? A one, and a two... </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Roll up the earnings, lemons are turning to gold.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">Roll up the earnings, lemons are turning to gold.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">Roll up the earnings, lemons are turning to gold.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You’ve got your earnings rolled up. Now, you should have $10 in Retained Earnings and zero in Earnings Week to Date. Complete the Balance Sheet below, to reflect this. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743750417" src="images/000141.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Retained Earnings will show us all the earnings in a business from when? <span class="bold">From </span><span class="bold">prior accounting periods.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What exactly are Retained Earnings? We said they are earnings from past accounting periods. There are only two things that happen to earnings&mdash;you either retain them in the business or distribute them to the owners of the company. In a corporation, a distribution of earnings means the company pays a dividend to the stockholders. Earnings that have not been distributed are retained in the company. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">For this week, our earnings will be recorded in Earnings Week to Date&mdash;because we always work in the current period.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s review. At the beginning of each new week in order to update our Ending Balance Sheet to make it a Beginning Balance Sheet we’re going to do what? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Roll up the earnings and retain them in the company and convert Ending Inventory </span><span class="bold">to Beginning Inventory.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Great! Now we’re ready to start the new week.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">As you wake Monday morning, you think, Why stay small? There’s no time like the present to start growing my lemonade business.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Real businesspeople don’t go on borrowing money from Mom and Dad. Real businesspeople borrow money from a real bank.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">After breakfast, you put on clean clothes and brush your hair. Then you get Mom or Dad to drive you to your neighborhood bank. You show the banker your financial statements. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The banker is dressed in a really nice suit that is incapable of attracting even a speck of dust. Meanwhile, while clean, you’re dressed in sneakers, jeans, and a T-shirt that says <span class="bold">KIDS RULE!! </span>As you sit in a chair that’s too big, you have to remind yourself to stop kicking your legs and to sit up straight and look grownup. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743750385" src="images/000175.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“I’ll be a good customer, I promise,” you tell the banker in a squeaky voice. “You won’t have to worry about getting your money back. I borrowed ten dollars from my parents and already paid it back.” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The banker looks up and nods. “Look at my balance sheet,” you say proudly. “I have $13.00 in cash. I have some inventory, no debt, and I started my business with five bucks and I had earnings last week of ten dollars.” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The banker glances over your scorecard, and nods. “Impressive,” the banker says. “There are a lot of grownup businesspeople who don’t keep this good a record.” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You’re pretty sure the banker just complimented you, though it’s hard to tell because the banker’s eyebrows and lips hardly move. “Do you give loans to kids?” you ask. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“We don’t discriminate because of a potential customer’s age, gender, religious, racial, or ethnic identity,” the banker says.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Which you’re pretty sure means “Yes” to your question.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Look at my income statement,” you go on. “Last week I had sales of $25. My gross profit was $15, these are my expenses, with a net profit of $10. Would you loan me $50.00?” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Impressed, the bank loans you $50.00 cash.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Hey, thanks,” you tell the banker. “I appreciate your interest in my business. You won’t be sorry! Come by my stand on your way home.” You start to leave, but you can’t help but turn back and say, “You know, with an original investment of $5 and a net profit of $10, that’s a 200 percent return on my investment. Hey, how’s the bank doing?” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Smiling, the banker wishes you well.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, please demonstrate what just happened on the next scorecard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">First, what comes in? <span class="bold">Cash</span>. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So bring in $50.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743750345" src="images/000016.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Are we in balance? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Who do we owe now? <span class="bold">The banker for $50.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Where do we show it? <span class="bold">Notes payable.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Demonstrate this on the next scorecard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743750329" src="images/000055.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Are we in balance now? <span class="bold">Yes!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">By the time you get home from the bank, it’s already lunch. It looks like it might rain. So you decide to give yourself the rest of the day off. (It helps when you’re your own boss!) But you’re afraid that the lemonade in the fridge might not last until tomorrow. You decide to sell your remaining inventory for $2.00 to your best friend at cost, for cash. Your best friend is always thirsty and loves your lemonade, so it’s a win-win. The only downer to an otherwise glorious day is that, since you’re home, your mom and dad insist you clean up your room. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Show the financial results of what just happened. How? By reducing inventory? <span class="bold">Yes, the whole thing. </span>But if you reduce inventory to zero, where do the two dollars go? <span class="bold">Well, your friend gave you two dollars, so add them to your Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743750313" src="images/000088.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Are we in balance? <span class="bold">Yes!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What happened? The two dollars’ worth lemonade turned into what? <span class="bold">Two </span><span class="bold">dollars in Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did anything change in terms of total assets? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did we have sale? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We just didn’t make any what? <span class="bold">Profit.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Will this transaction show up on our Income Statement? <span class="bold">Yes. </span>As part of what? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Total Sales. </span>Make a reminder to yourself to put this into your sales total when you fill out your Income Statement at the end of the week. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">After you return from your very brief vacation (interrupted by having to clean your room), you need to make up some new lemonade. You overhear Mom and Dad talking about paying their account at the grocery store, where they have a charge account. Hey, you think, maybe I can set up an account. It’s worth a try, right? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You tell your parents your idea and they say it’s worth a try. So, you get your bike out of the garage and pedal like crazy (watching for cars and crazy dogs, of course) down to the grocery store. Outside, you wait to catch your breath. You check your appearance in the big window. You moisten the tips of your finger with a little spit and plaster down the hair which got messed riding your bike. Your parents hate when you use spit, but this is an emergency! After all, you want Pappy Parker, the grocer, to see an entrepreneur, not just some sweaty kid. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743750272" src="images/000125.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Hey, Pappy,” you say, entering the store. “I’m in business now, just like you. It’s tough competing against the really big companies, isn’t it? Us little guys need to stick together. How about one businessperson helping out another? I’d like to buy 10 pounds of sugar at 40 cents/pound, for a total of $4.00.” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“I can handle that,” Pappy says with a wink. The grocer’s store is a family business. It sells everything from great fresh produce to racks of snacks in one big room. Even though the place is crowded with stuff and the linoleum on the floor is, like, fifty years old, you like it better than the enormous, impersonal supermarket. One reason is that good ol’ Pappy gives every kid who comes in a free cookie! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Another reason is the great customer service that the Pappy and everyone else working at his store provide. The grocery staff knows every customer by name. And you’ll always remember the time Pappy wouldn’t let your mom buy some fruit that looked too ripe. Instead, the ol’ Pap left the register and selected the best piece of fruit on display, then gave it to your mom for free. Yes sir, that Pappy sure knows how treat his customers right! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You really like good ol’ Pappy. He’s like your favorite uncle&mdash;or grandpa. This gives you the courage to add, “And I’d like to purchase the sugar on credit.” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Credit? Tell me, please, why would I give you credit?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Well, you give my parents credit. Can I have credit too?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“But your parents work for a living,” Pappy points out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“I’m working for a living, too,” you reply. “I’m selling fresh lemonade.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Lemonade? Is it good lemonade?” he asks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“The absolute best,most totally awesome lemonade in this part of the galaxy,” you say.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“That good? Are you trying to put me out of business?” Pappy says this with a smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Just the opposite,” you quickly respond. (It amazes you that every so often the ol’ brain charges in with a great reply!) “After all, the more lemonade I sell, the more lemons and sugar I’ll need to buy from you. Plus maybe paper cups and napkins. And maybe one day I’ll add cookies, which I’ll get from your bakery because they’re the best around.” You run out of great ideas and hope it’s enough to win over Pappy. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">He lives in the neighborhood and always gives free stuff to your school. Pappy’s known you and your family for a long time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Well, it sounds like you figured it all out,” he observes. “Maybe one day you’ll help me out with my business?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“You’ll give me credit?” you ask hopefully.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“I’ll give you $4.00 in credit,” Pappy says, handing you a piece of paper to sign.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Home, you unpack the grocery sack. What financial category is packed inside? <span class="bold">Inventory.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What kind of inventory? <span class="bold">Sugar.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much sugar? <span class="bold">$4.00. </span>What color? <span class="bold">White&mdash;just checking!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did you pay CASH for the sugar? <span class="bold">No! Is this a great country, or what?!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Do we owe money? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">In order for the grocer to keep track of the credit, what have we set up? <span class="bold">An </span><span class="bold">account.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And it’s payable to whom? <span class="bold">The grocer.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What do businesses call this sort of thing? <span class="bold">ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, now we have our second kind of liability. We had the note with the banker and now the account set up with the grocer. Demonstrate this latest transaction below. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743750186" src="images/000165.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What’s the difference between the two kinds of liabilities?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The Notes Payable from the bank shows that the bank gave you what? <span class="bold">Money!</span> And the Accounts Payable with the grocer shows that the grocer gave you what? <span class="bold">Sugar or Inventory.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, is it fair to say that Notes Payable has to do with money owed to someone else for money received, and Accounts Payable has to do with some things we got for our business which we have to pay for someday? <span class="bold">Yes. </span>In other words, for Notes Payable we got cash and for Accounts Payable we got goods or services. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">There is another difference between Notes Payable and Accounts Payable. It has to do with time. Generally speaking, a loan from a bank (Notes Payable) and a credit account (Accounts Payable) from a store have different payback periods. In other words, one is for a short time and one is for a longer time. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Which is which? <span class="bold">Accounts Payable is short-term, usually due in full in maybe thirty </span><span class="bold">days. Notes Payable is long-term, maybe several years. That’s why Accounts Payable </span><span class="bold">is the first item in Liabilities&mdash;they are generally ordered as they come due.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Any other difference? HINT: What’s one thing all bank loans come with that store credits generally don’t come with providing you promptly pay off your balance? <span class="bold">Interest!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Which has interest? <span class="bold">Notes Payable. Usually, Accounts Payable does not have interest </span><span class="bold">unless you don’t pay on time.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">In both cases, we’re establishing what? <span class="bold">Credit! </span>Hey, we’re pretty sharp entrepreneurs! Or at least a lot like Mom and Dad and most other businesses and consumers! We owe people money! Talk about feeling grownup! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now that we have some credit, it’s time to buy some other supplies. You buy 100 lemons at 20 cents/lemon. You want to keep in good with the grocer so you pay in cash. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The amount goes out of Cash, and into...what? <span class="bold">Inventory.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much inventory? <span class="bold">Twenty dollars in lemons come in.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Again, what did we do? We exchanged $20.00 in cash for what? <span class="bold">Twenty dollars </span><span class="bold">in inventory.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did we, in fact, exchange one asset for another. <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Bring the next scorecard up to date, reflecting these transactions.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743750117" src="images/000002.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Are we in balance? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You should have $69 in Assets, $54 in Liabilities, and $15 in Equity; the sum of the right side total is $69.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You’re doing great. You’re especially patient with all this record-keeping stuff.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But, believe me, you’ll be glad later.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now that our financial record-keeping is up to date, it’s time to take a break (if you wish). Then, let’s make up a fresh batch of the world’s greatest lemonade! </span></p>
</div>  <div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><div class="calibre1">
<p id="calibre_link-6" class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">CHAPTER 4</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743750100" src="images/000040.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">N</span>ow that you’re a pro at mixing lemonade, you make up a good sized batch. The batch takes fifty lemons (@ 20<img alt="7248" src="images/000187.jpg" class="calibre3" />/each) and five pounds of sugar (@ 40<img alt="7248" src="images/000187.jpg" class="calibre3" />/lb.), to make sixty glasses. What’s the cost of production? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Before we answer, let’s add another element. So far, you have made all your own lemonade, but this morning you decided to take off some time to go biking with friends. Still, you want to have the lemonade stand opened as soon as you return. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, you ask your older sister if she’ll make the lemonade for you. Most of the time you and your sister are pretty good buddies. But, suddenly, with your friends waiting outside, she turns into Scrooge! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Why should I do you any favors?” she asks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Come on,” you plead. “Just this once. I promise I won’t bug you the next time you’re on the phone.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“That’s not good enough,” she replies. “I’m no dummy. I’ve heard all that cash rattling in the cigar box. You have to pay me if you want your lemonade ready.” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Well, she has you now. Boy, wait until you’re rich and famous! See her come crawling for a favor then! But that’s a few years down the road, and now your friends are screaming for you to hurry up. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“You win,” you say with a sigh. “How much do you want?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">She smiles. She never is very modest in victory. “I want one dollar to make 60 glasses.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">First, you get angry at her smugness, then, you force yourself to calm down and decide to pay it. After all, business is business. “Fine,” you agree. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You give her the buck and head out the door. Once on your bike, with your friends, you reason this out. A dollar in labor cost is too much for sixty glasses&mdash;and it will lower your profit. But you figure you can afford it just this once. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">A while later, refreshed from your ride, you return in time for the afternoon sales and see, to your relief, that your sister has done her job well. There in the refrigerator are 60 glasses of fresh lemonade. Say, maybe this boss thing isn’t so bad, after all! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Seriously, let’s look at our Inventory. We’ve got two types of Inventory here. What do we call the lemons and sugar? <span class="bold">Raw materials.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And what kind of inventory is lemonade? <span class="bold">Finished goods.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, while we (or Big Sister) were making it, what kind of inventory was it? <span class="bold">Work-in-process&mdash;or WIP. Work-in-process is a big item for manufacturing companies.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We go from raw materials to work-in-process to finished goods.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We didn’t use up all of our raw materials, though, for this batch. As a result, we have both raw materials and finished goods in our inventory. Are the raw materials considered available for sale? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">For record-keeping purposes, all Inventory is available for sale.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Before we greet our afternoon customers, let’s fill out another Balance Sheet to reflect that we’ve just paid labor to make our product. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743750048" src="images/000076.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How did you account for the labor? <span class="bold">It reduced Cash by $1.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Here, though, is where it gets a little tricky. Many people would say, let’s expense it and reduce our earnings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">However, in this case, you cannot expense the dollar&mdash;and you may know why. It has to do with the job Big Sister was doing&mdash;specifically her labor was to produce your product. Literally, her labor increased the value of the Inventory&mdash;so, in truth, you should have taken the $1 from Cash and added $1 to Inventory. As a result, Cash is now $44 and Inventory is $25. Note that our Balance Sheet from now on will separate raw materials and finished goods. You should have $12 in raw materials and $13 in Finished Goods, and $25 in Total Inventory. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You can see now that the Cost of Production labor is “tied up” in inventory. That $1 cost cannot be recognized (or expensed) until the Inventory is sold. That’s one reason companies closely manage inventory quantities and always want to sell it quickly. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, let’s get selling!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">It’s a hot day and you’re sweating, but it’s OK because sales are very, very good. Your new location pays off, and easily earns back what you spent renting it. Kids from other neighborhoods&mdash;total strangers!&mdash;come by on their bikes, having heard about your great lemonade. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Some friends come by, with their tongues practically dragging on the pavement. “Please, please, give us some lemonade!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Give?” you repeat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“We left our money at home,” they explain. “But we’re good for it, we promise!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Since they’re friends, you let them buy their lemonade on credit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">By the end of the afternoon, your arm is about to fall off from pouring so much lemonade. But it’s all worth it when you total up your sales. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">60 glasses for 50 cents each </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">40 glasses cash and 20 glasses on account</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What’s your total sales? <span class="bold">Thirty dollars. </span>Twenty dollars Cash. Ten dollars on Account. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s review what happened here.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did you sell all the lemonade you made up? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How many glasses did you sell? <span class="bold">Sixty.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What goes out of the business? <span class="bold">Inventory.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much? <span class="bold">Thirteen dollars.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What comes in? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Cash for how much? <span class="bold">Twenty dollars.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So we get $20 for the forty glasses we sold for Cash. What else happened?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Some of your friends said they wanted to buy some lemonade, but they didn’t have any money. Their parents hadn’t given them what? <span class="bold">Their allowance. </span>So, they wanted to buy now, and pay when? <span class="bold">Later. </span>Did you, ever kind and wonderful and always on the outlook to increase sales, decide to sell to them? <span class="bold">Yes. </span>Admit it, did it make you a little nervous. <span class="bold">A bit. Sure. </span>Did you make a record of the sale? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Sure, the kids on credit are your friends and all&mdash;but this is business! You got out your little notebook and recorded these sales... Ted, 1 glass,.50, Natalie, 2 glasses, 1.00...etc. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What did your friends do? They set up an account with whom?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Right, with you!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did those thirsty kids get the lemonade? <span class="bold">Sure did.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Was it a sale? <span class="bold">Yes!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You just didn’t receive any...what? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, you had to set up an account.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Is this money owed to you right now? <span class="bold">Yes!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Pretty soon, though, you’ll want to go out and receive what? <span class="bold">The green stuff, Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, if you have to set up an account and plan to receive the cash from your friends, the account is called what? <span class="bold">Accounts Receivable. </span>Is an Account Receivable something we have? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">That means it’s a what? <span class="bold">An asset. </span>Since it’s money we are going to get soon, is it almost cash? <span class="bold">Yes. </span>What color should we make it? <span class="bold">Almost green.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did your friends promise, promise, promise to pay you? <span class="bold">Yes, And even did a pinkie </span><span class="bold">swear! </span>They said they were good for it. (And if you can’t trust your friends, who can you?) But, honestly, have they paid you yet? <span class="bold">No, not yet. but they better!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">They said they were going to get their allowance at the end of the week? <span class="bold">Yes, </span><span class="bold">Right before they chugged down the lemonade.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Was this a good idea? Why do businesses let people set up accounts? Ever hear of “buy now, pay later”? Right, to generate more sales! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Bring the next scorecard up to date, to show the changes in assets.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743749897" src="images/000116.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So are we in balance? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What do we need to show?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We need to record our profit or earnings for the week.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So how much did we have in total sales? <span class="bold">$30.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We had $20 in cash and $10 on account.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much did it cost us in lemonade? <span class="bold">$13.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So if it cost us $13.00 and we sold it for $30.00, what’s our profit or earnings for this sale? <span class="bold">$17.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Record your profit or earnings below.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743749871" src="images/000153.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Are we in balance? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Good job! Congratulate yourselves! Give yourself a high five! Put on a great CD or turn on your mp3 player and dance to the music! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Unfortunately, in business as in life, there are good times and bad times. No sooner are you dancing around your room than the phone rings. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">It’s a friend of yours telling you that one of your other friends, Johnny, the incredibly thirsty one who bought eight glasses on account has&mdash;gasp!&mdash;moved away! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">After throwing yourself to the ground and stamping the floor with your fists and crying, you conclude that this moved-away, no-good friend is unlikely to pay his debt. Given this sobering realization, you also conclude that this act of treachery will have a negative impact on your business and your financial records. Are this eight glasses a loss? <span class="bold">Of course! </span>What do you call this kind of loss? <span class="bold">Bad Debt. </span>This Bad Debt expense = $4.00 </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now what are we going to do?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Even as you regain control, you still can’t believe it! That kid promised to pay you! He even gave a pinkie swear, which is like the highest oath a kid can take! You figured he was good for it. But now he’s left town. Oh, well, at least he didn’t leave town thirsty&mdash;thanks to you! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Do we have to recognize the loss? <span class="bold">Yes. </span>We had $10.00 in Accounts Receivable, four of which belonged to that totally rude and worthless weasel cheater and all-around bad kid who you were once foolish enough to trust and call your friend. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">He’ll probably end up in prison, or politics&mdash;or both!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So what are we going to do? You list your options.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Send out the collection agency.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Hire a hitman.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Hire a lawyer.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Tell your parents.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Get your big brother or sister to beat him up.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Put a spell on him so he stays short his </span><span class="bold">whole life.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">E-mail the President to call out the </span><span class="bold">National Guard.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But you’re a business person, remember? So what do we do to recognize a bad debt?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Reduce Accounts Receivable? <span class="bold">Sadly, yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Reduce it by how much? <span class="bold">Four whole dollars.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Are we in balance now? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Is the Bad Debt a cost of doing business? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And a cost of doing business is called what? <span class="bold">An expense.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And expenses always reduce what? <span class="bold">Earnings.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, reduce earnings by $4.00 to reflect the bad debt expense.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743749782" src="images/000185.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, are we in balance? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">On which financial statement are we going to record the Bad Debt expense? <span class="bold">Right, we’d write it on the Income Statement. </span>For how much? <span class="bold">$4.00 (Expenses).</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Take a moment and catch your breath.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Sobered by the experience of the bad debt, you decide to repay $25.00 of the bank loan. We want a good relationship with our banker. You hope you’ll never be labeled a “bad debt.” So, you take $25.00 out of our cigar box. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You bike to the bank and find the loan officer you dealt with before. “Here’s $25.00 on the loan,” you say. “I did really good selling lemonade and I want to pay you back. Thanks a lot!” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The bank seems pleased as you hand over the money. But something tells you that the banker isn’t done yet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Is there something else?” you ask.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“How about the interest?” replies the banker.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Oh, yeah,” you say. “Mom and Dad said something about that. I remember when I repaid the money I borrowed from my Mom and Dad they wanted a hug,” you add. “Do you want a hug, too? Is that interest?” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The banker doesn’t want a hug. What the banker wants is real interest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Interest?” you say. “Boy, how much interest?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Two dollars,” the banker says.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Two dollars?! My parents just wanted a hug, they didn’t charge any interest. But you want interest instead?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The banker nods very slowly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Okay,” you sigh, reaching into your pocket for the two dollars. “I’ll pay the interest. This must be the real world. Well, thanks for taking an interest in my business.” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, what goes out in cash? <span class="bold">$27.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">On the right side, let’s take $27.00 out of the Notes Payable! <span class="bold">No!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Why not?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Because $25 is for the principal on the Note and $2 is for what? <span class="bold">Interest expense.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What do you have to reduce by $2 on the right side, to account for the interest expense. <span class="bold">$2 off Earnings Week to Date.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, the interest is a cost of doing business with whom? <span class="bold">The bank.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And a cost of doing business is an expense which reduces what? <span class="bold">Earnings.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Show these transactions on the next scorecard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743749706" src="images/000026.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, hey! We had to pay out some extra money to do business with the bank.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What part of this transaction shows up on our Income Statement? <span class="bold">The Interest </span><span class="bold">Expense for $2.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The interest expense shows up on the Income Statement. But not borrowing the cash or paying back the principal of the loan. It’s the extra money or the cost of doing business with the bank&mdash;that expense shows up on our Income Statement. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">This is important, and worth repeating. Interest expense shows up on the Income Statement as an expense.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You get another lesson about the real world when your neighbors, the ones renting you space on their lawn, become concerned with all the kids and their bikes and skateboards and roller blades around on their sidewalk and front lawn. They asked you to talk with your parents about buying an insurance policy. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Your parents agree that an insurance policy is a good idea. They agree to drive you to their insurance agent’s office.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You enter the All-Safe Farm Insurance office. The agent greets you and gives you a desk calendar before you even sit down. It has large color pictures of things like red barns, mountains, forests in autumn, and kittens. It’s not exactly to your taste, but, remembering your manners, you thank the agent. Secretly, though, you plan on giving it to your friend’s little sister to cut up. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Now, what can I do for you?” the agent asks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“I want to buy an insurance policy for my lemonade business,” you say. “I need one that will cover me just for the summer. Can I buy one just for this year?” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The agent says it’s best to buy one for three years. In fact, he adds, he only has a three-year policy which costs $3 payable in advance. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“You mean I have to pay now, in advance, for three years?” you say. “But I only want one for this year because who knows what I’ll be doing next year. How much is it anyway?” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Three dollars,” the agent tells you.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Boy,” you say, “that seems like a lot to have to buy one in advance for three years...”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The agent insists it’s the only way to go.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Okay,” you sigh, reaching into your pocket for three dollars. “Here’s the $3 for the policy and be sure to come by the lemonade stand. After all, I gave you some business. It’s only fair that you give me some, too!” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So you give the agent how much? <span class="bold">$3.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And you get what? <span class="bold">An insurance policy.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743749661" src="images/000064.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">An insurance policy especially designed just for lemonade stands. And don’t forget that free, attractive desk calendar!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And this policy is going to cover you for how many years? <span class="bold">Three years.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So now you have got this policy? Does it have value? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You have it now, right? It’s something you now have for your business. So, where does it show up? <span class="bold">On the Balance Sheet.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Where? <span class="bold">On the Asset side.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What goes out? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much? <span class="bold">$3.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And what comes in? <span class="bold">An insurance policy.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did we pay for it in advance? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">For how many years? <span class="bold">Three.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much per year? <span class="bold">One dollar.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">It’s an expense then, that you paid in advance. So, what should we call this item? <span class="bold">How about PREPAID EXPENSE.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">For how much? <span class="bold">$3.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now we have a Prepaid Expense, the insurance, for $3.00.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Please record these transactions.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743749604" src="images/000104.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Each time we’ve talked about expenses, we’ve said they reduce earnings. What makes an expense an Asset? <span class="bold">When we pay in advance and it has value INTO future </span><span class="bold">accounting periods.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">This is a special policy designed just for lemonade stands. What’s going to happen to the first year when we buy this policy? <span class="bold">Right, it’s going to get used up!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So how do we reflect that on our scorecards?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">The first year is a Current Expense.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So what do we do? <span class="bold">Take one dollar off the Prepaid Expense.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Subtract ONE dollar from the prepaid expense. This year’s insurance gets used up. So a dollar goes out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Are we in balance now? <span class="bold">No!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, what needs to happen on the right side of the board? <span class="bold">We take a dollar out of </span><span class="bold">Earnings Week to Date.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Enter these transactions below.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743749569" src="images/000138.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Why do we take $1.00 out of earnings? <span class="bold">Because it’s a current expense.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We paid three dollars for how many years? <span class="bold">Three years.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">For how much per year? <span class="bold">One dollar per year.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If we go back to the agency and say we’ve decided to get out of the lemonade business, our insurance agent’s going to give us back how much? <span class="bold">$2.00. So a Prepaid </span><span class="bold">Expense has value and is an Asset.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The policy right now is worth how much? <span class="bold">$2.00, Right!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">For which years? <span class="bold">Year 2 + year 3.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Have we used those years yet? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And the ONE dollar we’re taking when? <span class="bold">Now. As a current expense.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What happens next year? <span class="bold">Another dollar goes out.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And the next year? <span class="bold">Still another dollar goes out.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">In truth, we’ve taken some liberties in how we did this. Would we expense the whole first year’s expense of $1 all at once? <span class="bold">No. </span>Since we’re operating on a weekly basis, we’d take how much each week? <span class="bold">1/52. Right! </span>But we’re not going to mess with change at the moment, so we’re going to take the whole first year’s expense all at once, even though you’d expense in reality a little bit each month, or each week. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay. Now, for the last few pages, we’ve been using a very, very, very specific method of accounting.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We’ve been accounting for everything as it happens, whether or not we’ve paid out or received any what? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, we account for everything as it happens&mdash;or, as accountants would say, as it accrues.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Do you know what this accounting method is called? <span class="bold">The ACCRUAL METHOD.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Right, the Accrual Method. We’ve been accounting for everything as it happens, whether or not we paid or received any what? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The Accrual Method started when people stopped paying cash for everything.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Business promises and agreements took place, but the cash settlements were made at a later date. The Accrual Method of accounting creates an accurate measure of a company’s financial position even though the cash has not been settled. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s look at this a little closer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did you receive any cash for our accounts receivable? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did you sell the lemonade to your friends? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Are we accounting for it as a sale? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">At this point in time does it have value? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did you earn this money? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You just didn’t receive any...what? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, on the Accrual Method, sales are recognized not as the money is received but when it is what? <span class="bold">Earned.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How about the inventory?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did we get the sugar?<span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did we pay cash for it? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But we did what? <span class="bold">Charged it&mdash;put it on account.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did this purchase happen? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Do you owe Pappy Parker, the grocer? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did we record that you owe it? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, on the Accrual Method, we account for purchases when they happen or when we owe them, not when we pay for them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s look at the Prepaid Expense.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much did the insurance policy cost? <span class="bold">$3.00 in cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did we use up all $3.00 worth of insurance this year? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much of the insurance happens this year or how much did we actually use this year? <span class="bold">$1.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Right, we only used $1.00 of the insurance. So we account for the insurance as it happens or as we use it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, in the Accrual Method of accounting, we account for everything when we...<span class="bold">Earn it.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Or when we...<span class="bold">Owe it.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Or when we...<span class="bold">Use it.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, you’re accounting for everything as it accrues or as it happens.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">This accounting method is called what? <span class="bold">The Accrual Method.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And on the accrual method you account for everything when? <span class="bold">When it happens.</span> Whether or not you’ve paid or received any...<span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">One more time, on the Accrual Method you account on transaction when...? <span class="bold">You </span><span class="bold">earn it, owe it, or use it.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Great! Let’s take a snapshot of our scorecard&mdash;and, while we’re at it, a motion picture clip, too. It’s the end of your second week in the lemonade business. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Here is a reprint of your final Balance Sheet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743749383" src="images/000172.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, using the Accrual Method of accounting, you’re going to fill out your own Income Statement on page 63. But first you need more information. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And, to put it all in one place, here’s information about this week’s purchases, sales and expenses that you’ll need to complete the income statement. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">1. After a successful first week in the lemonade biz you decide to go to the bank. You show the banker your financial statements and the bank loans you $50.00 Cash. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">2. You decide to give yourself an afternoon off, and sell your remaining inventory to your best friend $2.00 at cost, for Cash. Your sale, at cost = $2.00. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">3. With your Inventory reduced to zero, you purchase 10 lbs. of sugar @ 40<img alt="7248" src="images/000187.jpg" class="calibre3" />/lb., and charge it to the grocer on account for $4.00. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">4. You purchase 100 lemons @ 20<img alt="7248" src="images/000187.jpg" class="calibre3" />/lemon, paying cash $20.00. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">5. You make up one batch of lemonade (50 lemons + 5 lbs. of sugar = 60 glasses). You also pay $1.00 labor to make the lemonade. Cost of Production = $13.00. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">6. Sales are good. You sell all 60 glasses for 50<img alt="7248" src="images/000187.jpg" class="calibre3" /> each, 40 glasses Cash and 20 glasses on account. Your Sales = $30.00, $20.00 Cash, and $10.00 in Accounts Receivable. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">7. One customer who had bought 8 glasses moves away from town. You conclude that he’s unlikely to pay his debt. Bad Debt Expense = $4.00. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">8. You repay $25.00 of the bank loan, plus $2.00 for interest expense.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">9. You pay $3.00 for a 3-year liability insurance policy. Reflect this year’s insurance expense for $1.00.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Go line by line from 1 to 9, looking for these three things:</span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">Is it a Sale?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">Is it a Purchase? OR </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">Is it an Expense?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Your decision should help you complete the Income Statement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">There is one item that you need to fill out on your Income Statement that you won’t find on the balance sheet and you won’t find it in the list of transactions we just went through. Do you know what it is?...<span class="bold">Beginning Inventory.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, this latest Balance Sheet is for which week? <span class="bold">Right, week number 2.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">It’s not a Beginning Balance Sheet, it’s a what? <span class="bold">Ending Balance Sheet! </span>Good. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The inventory we have left at the end of this second week is...? <span class="bold">Ending Inventory.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s look at this for a moment because it’s important.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We finished week two with how much ending inventory? <span class="bold">Twelve dollars.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So we know that the Beginning Inventory for week three will be how much? <span class="bold">Right, $12.</span> Because the Ending Inventory always becomes the Beginning Inventory next week. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Is the Beginning Inventory for week two handy? Where could you find it? <span class="bold">The </span><span class="bold">Ending Balance Sheet from week one.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Here is week one’s Ending Balance sheet for easy reference:</span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">WEEK ONE&ndash;ENDING BALANCE SHEET</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743749304" src="images/000012.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What was the Beginning Inventory for week number two? <span class="bold">Two dollars.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And where did you go to find the $2? <span class="bold">On last week’s Ending Balance Sheet, The </span><span class="bold">Ending Inventory.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, you always go to the Ending Balance Sheet from the last week to find your Beginning Inventory for this week.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">One more time. The ending inventory automatically becomes what? <span class="bold">The </span><span class="bold">Beginning Inventory for the Next Week.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Good. Now we’re wrapping up our second week. Where do you find your Ending Inventory for week two? <span class="bold">On week two’s Ending Balance Sheet.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay. Good. Here’s that ending balance sheet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">WEEK TWO&ndash;ENDING BALANCE SHEET</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743749275" src="images/000056.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s quickly review the balance sheet </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Assets equal? <span class="bold">Assets = $54.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Liabilities + Owner’s Equity equal? <span class="bold">Liabilities + Owner’s Equity = $54.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Does the left side equal the right side? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The left side always, always equals what? <span class="bold">The right side.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Good job!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, please complete the Income Statement. And do you remember what numbers should match on the Balance Sheet and Income Statement? <span class="bold">Net Profit should </span><span class="bold">equal Earnings Week to Date. </span>So, we know that Net Profit should end up at $10&mdash;or you’ve made a mistake. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743749248" src="images/000089.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743749247" src="images/000126.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What were your total sales? <span class="bold">Total Sales = $32.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">By chance, did you first have $30.00 for total sales. If so, where did the other two dollars come from? <span class="bold">Yes, the sale to your friend at cost.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We’re going to point out all the cash and non-cash items to help you better understand the Accrual Method.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">To review, then:</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">First, we had the $2 sale. Was it Cash? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Then we had the $30 sale. How much was Cash? <span class="bold">Twenty dollars.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And the ten dollars was what? <span class="bold">On Account.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The Beginning Inventory was what? <span class="bold">$2.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Was that Cash? <span class="bold">No. It was lemonade.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How about purchases? <span class="bold">$24.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much was cash? <span class="bold">$20.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And the $4 was what? <span class="bold">Accounts Payable.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And the labor was how much? <span class="bold">$1.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Was it paid for with cash? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So the total available Beginning Inventory + Purchases + Labor is what? <span class="bold">$27.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And did we use all the Inventory? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What was our ending Inventory? <span class="bold">$12.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If we subtract that from the total available, what are the Costs of Goods Sold? <span class="bold">$15.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We sold the $15 worth of goods for $32 which left us how much in Gross Profit? <span class="bold">$17.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What were the expenses this week? <span class="bold">Bad debt, Interest, Insurance.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The Bad Debt was what? <span class="bold">$4.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did you pay Cash for that?<span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Interest was how much? <span class="bold">$2.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And did we pay Cash for that? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Finally, the insurance was what? Only $1 because we are using which method of accounting? <span class="bold">The Accrual Method.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But, did we pay Cash? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So the total expenses are? <span class="bold">$7.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">With a Gross Profit of $17 and $7 in expenses, what is the bottom line? <span class="bold">$10.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And does this match our earnings on the Balance Sheet? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If you got $10 on the Income Statement (Net Profit) and $10 on the balance sheet (Earnings Week to Date), please give yourself a gold star! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, say you were just handed an Income Statement on a computer printout and you saw this 32.00 in Sales with a dollar sign next to it, your linear left brain would probably think that these total sales of $32 were all what? <span class="bold">Cash!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But is this $32.00 all cash? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743749121" src="images/000161.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Some of it’s what? <span class="bold">Receivables.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But we’re accounting for it as $32.00 worth of what? <span class="bold">Sales.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But is it all cash? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">It’s cash and other things. So, it’s cash and non-cash values.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And unless you went back to your sales journal and figured out what your receivables and cash sales were, you’d have no way of knowing what part of the total sales of $32.00 was Cash and what part was the Accounts Receivable. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If you just look at the $32.00, you wouldn’t know what part was Cash and what part was non-cash sales.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, let’s look at Beginning Inventory. Is inventory Cash? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So we had $2 worth of lemonade here.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We know we paid cash for some of our purchases and we know we charged some of our purchases. How much did we pay cash for? <span class="bold">$20.00 </span>And we charged...? <span class="bold">$4.00. </span>But when you look at this $24.00 in purchases your left brain might think again, that you paid for everything with all what? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But did you? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Next, you paid $1.00 cash for labor. If you look at the $15 Cost of Goods Sold, would you even know what part of that you paid cash for? And what you charged? <span class="bold">Forget it! I can barely remember what I ate for dinner last night!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Besides, this Cost of Goods Sold...that relates only to what? <span class="bold">Lemonade.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, $15 in COGS is the cost of the lemons, sugar and labor that went into making up the lemonade that you sold.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And $15 from $32 gives us a Gross Profit of $17.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, let’s look at these expenses.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Which one did we not pay cash for? <span class="bold">Bad Debt.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, that’s not cash. We did pay cash for what? <span class="bold">Interest and Insurance.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">(By the way, you don’t expense glass rental, rent, and advertising for week two because they happened last week.)</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, when we look at the $7 in total expenses; if you were looking at a financial statement and you saw $7.00 in total expenses your linear left brain again wouldn’t know any better and would think you’d paid for all of these expenses with what? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But did you? <span class="bold">No way. </span>So, this $7 is again a mixture of Cash and non-cash expenses. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The point is, on the Accrual Method, in order to understand this method this financial statement here is treated as a “Not-Only-Cash” Income Statement. Because it has Cash and non-cash things all mixed in together. Do you know what happened in Cash here and what didn’t? <span class="bold">Not unless we have an extraordinary </span><span class="bold">memory and write everything down.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You have to treat this as a “non-cash-statement” or a not-only-cash statement. By the way, this is not accounting jargon, but it’s a lay person’s way of remembering the Accrual Method. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now let’s look back at our Balance Sheet. Are all our Assets Cash? <span class="bold">No. </span>Most of the Assets are what? <span class="bold">Non-cash things like our Accounts Receivable, Inventory, and </span><span class="bold">prepaid expense.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Our total Assets are what? <span class="bold">$54.00, and a mixture of Cash + non-cash values.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But our linear left brain might look at this $54 in total Assets and again think it was all what? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But is it? <span class="bold">It’s Cash and everything else.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, on the Accrual Method we account for everything when it happens, whether or not we’ve paid or received any cash. Since it’s a mixture of cash and non-cash, we call it a what? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">A Not-Only-Cash method. </span>So, there’s cash and non-cash values mixed in on the accrual method. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You’ve probably heard the statement, “They are using creative accounting.” You may think this means someone is doing something shady or illegal&mdash;but there are legitimate and legal forms of “creative accounting,” and we’re going to look at one now. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The Accrual Method is not the only method of keeping track of earnings. Can you guess what the other method is called? <span class="bold">The Cash Method.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, let’s go back and look at week number 2 using the Cash Method and we’re going to need to see things very differently. We can then compare the Cash and Accrual Methods. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Some of you may want a physical way of remembering things. If so, get your finger and tie a green string (green for Cash) around it to guarantee that you will remember this forever. Repeat the following. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">Cash is Cash is Cash!</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, switch to your other hand and tie a green string around your finger and repeat again:</span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">Cash is Cash is Cash!</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So on the Cash Method you would account for things ONLY when they happen in what? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, only events happening in cash are accounted for on the Cash Method. Remember that in the accrual method, everything is accounted for as it is earned, owed, and used. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">On the Cash Method, you account for things when you receive what? <span class="bold">Cash. </span>And when you pay what? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The Cash Method, obviously, is very different from the Accrual Method where you Account for a transaction regardless of whether you paid or received cash. You can expect that the results will be different. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay. We’ve been on what kind of method the whole day? <span class="bold">Accrual.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But now, we are only going to do a Cash Income Statement to show the contrast of the Cash and Accrual Methods. You will need to look back at the Accrual Method Income Statement on page 65 as you complete the Cash Method Income Statement below. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743748961" src="images/000030.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s begin with sales. What would be the total sales on the cash method?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">$22.00 Total Sales.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Why is it only $22, instead of the $32 on the Accrual Method? <span class="bold">The Accounts </span><span class="bold">Receivable doesn’t show up.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Moving down, is Beginning Inventory cash? <span class="bold">No. So nothing will show up there.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much did we have in cash purchases? <span class="bold">$20.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And how much in cash for labor? <span class="bold">$1.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What would our Cost of Goods sold be on the Cash Method? <span class="bold">$21.00. Right!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, whatever, we paid Cash for is our Cost of Goods Sold!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Which means, we don’t even account for what? <span class="bold">The sugar. </span>Why? <span class="bold">Because we </span><span class="bold">charged it.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">It’s not accounted for because we charged it; we didn’t pay what? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So if sales are $22 and COGS is $21, what is the Gross Profit?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">$1.00. WOW! All that hard work for one measly buck! No wonder some really lucky </span><span class="bold">kids get their parents to send them to camp!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s look at Expenses:</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Does the Bad Debt show up? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Because it’s not what? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How about interest? <span class="bold">Yes, $2.00, because you paid out cash for that.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How about the insurance? <span class="bold">Yes. </span>Okay, but $1.00 or $3.00? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much did you pay out in Cash? <span class="bold">$3.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, yes, you can expense all $3 this year? Wow! Because you paid for it, with what? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, we’re going to take the whole $3 for all three years this year. We paid for it with cash in advance, so we’re going to take all three years worth of expense now. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Total Expenses are $5. If Gross Profit is one dollar and Expenses are $5, what’s the Net Profit. <span class="bold">$-4.00. Yikes! This is going from bad to worse!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s look at these two Income Statements.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We used two methods. Did we get different results? <span class="bold">Yes! The Accrual Method +$10 </span><span class="bold">in Earnings and the cash Method was -$4.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, you can see that businesses have an opportunity here to be creative in how they account for things. Which method would you want to use? <span class="bold">Accrual.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Accrual, why? <span class="bold">It looks better&mdash;to take to the bank or investors&mdash;because it has </span><span class="bold">more profit.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">For what other reason would you use the Accrual Method? <span class="bold">It’s more accurate&mdash;</span><span class="bold">everything that happened is accounted for.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Why use the Cash Method? <span class="bold">For tax purposes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Oh, with minus $4 in earnings, will you owe any taxes? <span class="bold">No. In fact, you might get </span><span class="bold">some refund.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Can you use the Cash Method in our lemonade business? <span class="bold">Good question!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Well, some businesses can use the Cash Method and some cannot. There is one item on the Balance Sheet that determines whether or not you can use the Cash Method. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What is it? <span class="bold">Inventory.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Yes, any business with inventory must use only which method? <span class="bold">Accrual.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Does the lemonade stand have inventory? <span class="bold">Yes. </span>So which method do we have to use? <span class="bold">Accrual.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s look at why a company with inventory can’t use the Cash Method.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">At the end of every year, if we saw that we were going to make a profit and have to pay taxes, we could just run out and buy a lot of inventory and pay cash for it, and then take it all as COGS and reduce our profit so we wouldn’t have to pay any taxes. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Do you think the government would like that? Since we have a business that sells inventory, do you think the government will allow us to report on the cash method? <span class="bold">No way!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What kind of businesses can be on the Cash Method? <span class="bold">Service business, like doctors, </span><span class="bold">lawyers, accountants, seminar companies, consultants, real estate companies, </span><span class="bold">cleaning services. etc.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What’s the deciding factor? <span class="bold">Inventory.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, you mean to tell me that our lemonade stand can’t report to the IRS using the Cash Method? <span class="bold">Sorry it’s the law.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What accounting method do we have to report on? <span class="bold">Accrual.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Because we have what? <span class="bold">Inventory.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So if you’re delivering a service, the IRS says it’s okay for you to be on which method?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And for those of us in manufacturing, retail, or wholesale with inventory for sale we must be on which method? <span class="bold">Accrual.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">For the sake of argument, what would happen next year if we could be on the Cash Method? On the Cash Method, we’ll take $3 this year for our insurance expense. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Can we take any of the insurance next year as an expense? <span class="bold">No. </span>So what’s going to happen? Our profit’s going to go up. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, for those service businesses that can be on the Cash Method, they take as many expenses now so they can pay less what? <span class="bold">Taxes, right!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">When will it catch up with them? <span class="bold">Next year.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">They weren’t getting out of paying taxes, just what? <span class="bold">Delaying.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Have you ever heard the saying “a tax deferred is a tax reduced”? The theory is you’re going to defer taxes this year and when you do have to pay them, you’ll pay for them with what kind of dollars? <span class="bold">Cheaper or inflated. </span>And who gets to use the money you saved by deferring taxes? <span class="bold">You do!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So that’s the game. If you’re a manufacturer, can you do this? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What method is the most accurate reflection of reality and profitability? <span class="bold">Accrual.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What method are we running your lemonade business on? <span class="bold">Accrual.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Can a service company keep both sets of books?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Guess what? In the service business, we can report to the government on the Cash Method, and keep our books on the Accrual Method to show the banks or investors. Sounds like two sets of books...pretty shady! Can we have two sets of books? <span class="bold">Yes. It’s called “Creative Accounting.”</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Guess what happens at the end of the year? We give our books to our accountant and what does our accountant do? Turns it into the Cash Method for whom? <span class="bold">For the IRS.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">A lot of businesses run the business on the Accrual basis and submit to the government on the Cash basis for tax purposes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Can you switch methods? Be very creative? The government will always allow a business to switch from the Cash to the Accrual Method (they will most likely collect more taxes), but you cannot switch the other way. So if you start a service company and want to use the Cash Method, you need to elect that method the first year. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What about service companies that have some inventory they sell? Like a seminar company that sells books?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">This can get into a gray area where there is disagreement between the business owner and the IRS. The IRS will ask, “Is the inventory material to the generation of profit to the business?” If the answer is “yes,” then you have to use the Accrual Method. If “no,” you can use the Cash Method. The gray area is how much is “material to generating profit” and most businesses would consult its Certified Public Accountant (CPA) on this issue, but it doesn’t take much. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Before closing this chapter, let’s review it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">On the Accrual Method you account for things when? <span class="bold">When they happen.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">When you earn it and when you...what? <span class="bold">Owe it.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Or when you? <span class="bold">Use it.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Whether or not you’ve paid or received any what? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And on the Cash Method, cash is cash is cash.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And you only account for things when they happen in cash or when you what?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Pay it or receive it.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">PHEW!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You’re doing great! Take a break before we move on the next bit of business!</span></p>
</div>  <div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><div class="calibre1">
<p id="calibre_link-7" class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">CHAPTER 5</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743748685" src="images/000067.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">I</span>t’s only been two weeks that you’ve been in the lemonade business, and already your fame is spreading! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The local neighborhood newspaper ran an article about you on page five! There you were, photographed at the lemonade stand, proud as punch....Okay, maybe make that proud as lemonade! The article quoted your mom and dad saying how it was all your idea and how proud they are of you. It quoted Pappy Parker saying he wished there were more kids like you. It quoted a few kids who said your lemonade was the best they’ve ever tasted&mdash;and they weren’t even your friends! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You’re trying not to get a swelled head over all of this. After all, it’s not like you saved the world or something really important. Still, some of the neighborhood kids start coming to you for advice about starting their own lemonade businesses. “Wow, should I do this?” you ask yourself. You have to consider your own business. These kids are asking you to help create competition for yourself. You decide you will definitely not work with anyone near enough to open a stand in your own neighborhood. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The phone keeps ringing off the hook with kids wanting your help in starting their businesses. The demand is such that&mdash;being a genius on your good days&mdash;you realize this means that to do this you have to start a second business yourself! But you’re only one person. How can you run both your own lemonade stand and a consulting business? Do you really want to expand? Do you want to become a consultant? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Finally, you realize that you need some consulting yourself, so you call your favorite aunt, Jane, for some advice. Aunt Jane has run her own management consulting firm for years. How will I be able to run two businesses is your question for Jane. Your aunt says you will have to hire some friends and let them start out running the stand and you can train them to be consultants. Your next question is, “Should I combine my financial records for the consulting firm with the lemonade stand financial statements or set up a separate business?” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Jane says that you can do either, but reminds you that consulting is a different kind of business&mdash;it’s a service business. You immediately remember what we all learned in the last chapter&mdash;services businesses do not have inventory and can gain a tax advantage by using the Cash Method of accounting for reporting to the IRS. You figure that’s for you and decide to start a second business&mdash;the Real Good Lemonade Consulting Company. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Next you ask Aunt Jane how to charge for your consulting services. She starts talking about “billable hours” and you say, “Huh?” What she means is that service businesses are all about managing and optimizing the use of time. At the lemonade stand you have to manage your product, lemonade, and your time, but a consultant’s only inventory is his or her time. Aunt Jane says that what this means is you don’t make money unless you are doing something that you can bill to the customer. You need to come up with an hourly or daily billing rate. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You ask Jane if the Balance Sheet and Income Statement are different for a service business. Jane asks you to get out a Balance Sheet from your lemonade stand. She is impressed by how well organized you are and particularly by your innovation of using color to help understand the Balance Sheet items. She asks you what is the one item on your lemonade stand Balance Sheet that will not be on a service company’s Balance Sheet. “Inventory,” you tell her. (You love easy questions!) That’s the only difference if you are using the Accrual Method of accounting. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Aunt Jane says the Income Statement is a different story. She says that since there is no Ending Inventory to subtract out of costs, services companies really only have Sales and Expenses. That makes it really easy to do your Income Statement. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You start to feel agitated.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Aunt Jane,” you say, “wouldn’t a service company want to separate its overhead costs to run the daily operation from its direct costs?” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">She can’t believe how smart you are. She promises you a future job on the spot.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Aunt Jane says that, indeed, most service companies separate costs into two categories&mdash;Cost of Services and Expenses. Cost of Services are the costs directly related to providing a service. Expenses are all the overhead costs or costs to run the business, just like in our lemonade stand. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">As we noted earlier, the structure of such a service company’s Income Statement would be:</span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">Sales </span><span class="bold">- Cost of Services </span><span class="bold">= Gross Profit </span><span class="bold">- Expenses </span><span class="bold">= Net Profit</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Many of you reading this book either work in service companies or for large companies with inventory that have service divisions. The purpose of this chapter is to help you better understand service company issues and accounting and give you a chance to do some practice determining which items go into Cost of Services (some people call it Cost of Sales) and which into Expense. We will get back to our lemonade stand in the next chapter. Please don’t confuse what we are doing in this brief chapter on service businesses with your lemonade stand business. The numbers here will not affect what we’ve done earlier. It’s a question of apples and oranges&mdash;or lemons! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Since the Balance Sheets for the two types of companies are the same (except for Inventory), we will not focus on the Balance Sheet at all in this chapter. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, let’s pretend to shoot forward in time a couple of months. You did hire some friends who learned your business’s core competencies rapidly helping you out at the lemonade stand. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Thanks to the article in the local newspaper and great word of mouth, your new consulting business and its two employees get busy in a hurry. Encouraged by this response, you take out a classified ad for the business. Your younger brother, Michael, wants to get involved, so you promise him a $1 sales commission on any contract he brings into the business. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay, let’s go consult!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Hot after sales leads, Michael sends the newspaper article to your dad’s half sister, Sue, and her husband, Eric. They have two kids, your cousins, Amanda and Laura, who want to start a lemonade stand and be just like you. Aunt Sue thinks this is hilarious, since Amanda is always complaining when her younger sister Laura tries to copy her. Still, she wants to help them&mdash;and you. Who knows? Maybe in the process all of you will learn important lessons. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You sell Aunt Sue three days of consulting for two consultants at $8 per day for each consultant and include all travel costs in the daily rate. They live in the next town which is 30 miles away, requiring two overnights in a local hotel for your two consultants. Luckily, your employees’ parents volunteer to go along and pay for the hotel. The cost for travel (gas for cars) comes to $6. Plus, you pay the consultants $2.00 per day for every day they work with clients. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Your younger brother, Michael, agrees to do the administrative work for the contract and other office tasks. You pay him $2 for the week. You also give him the $1 sales commission he earned by selling this job to Aunt Sue. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Since the newspaper article brought you such a good response, you decide to continue the ad in the next issue. Advertising the new business costs $4. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Your two consultants work Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday with the clients (your cousins). They take along $2 worth of lemons and $1 worth of sugar to demonstrate how to make lemonade, in case your cousins decide to go with your amazing, awesome, totally appetizing secret recipe. (Hey, if McDonald’s can franchise, why can’t you?!) </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">On Thursday, back home, they work all day developing a new consulting product for your Real Good Lemonade Consulting Company to sell. (It’s a leadership course for shy kids called, “DON’T BE SHY&mdash;GET THEM TO BUY!”). You only pay the consultants $1.50 per day when they are working at the office. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">On Friday, they performed general and administrative tasks at the office (your basement playroom).</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, it’s time to practice. Using the above transactions, complete the following Income Statement for the Real Good Lemonade Consulting Company. Your main task is to determine which items go into Cost of Services and which go into Expenses. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Remember, Cost of Services is any cost directly related to providing the service and Expenses are all the cost of doing business not directly related to providing the service. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743748606" src="images/000102.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay, let’s see how you did.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The client (Aunt Sue and Uncle Eric) bought three days at $8/day per consultant. You sent two consultants. So, what was the total revenue? <span class="bold">$48.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">What did you put into Cost of Services? Well, you had to pay your consultants </span><span class="bold">$2.00/day times 2 consultants times 3 days = $12.00 You had to pay for their travel </span><span class="bold">costs ($6.00). They took along $3.00 worth of product which was used for demonstration </span><span class="bold">purposes and left with the client.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, your Cost of Services are? <span class="bold">$21.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Following our formula, subtracting Cost of Services from Sales leaves you with a Gross Profit (Income) of...? <span class="bold">$27.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, what items were in Expenses? <span class="bold">Remember, Expenses are costs not directly </span><span class="bold">related to the delivery of services.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You paid Michael a sales commission ($1.00) and paid for some advertising in the newspaper ($4.00).</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Michael also did the administrative work for the contract and other office tasks ($2.00). Then, on Friday, your consultants, each earning $1.50, spent the day performing administrative tasks at your office. (They claim they were busy with paperwork, though you suspect mostly they played Solitaire on your family’s computer.) </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">There’s one more expense. How much did DON’T BE SHY&mdash;GET THEM TO BUY! cost you to develop? <span class="bold">$3.00 for Research and Development.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, what are the total expenses? <span class="bold">$13.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We’re almost done. Last thing, subtracting Expenses from Gross Income leaves us with a Net Income of...? <span class="bold">$14.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, you may be wondering about a few things. One may be how we handled the sales commission. Some of you may want sales commission to go in Cost of Services, since you can argue that it is a direct cost of the sale. But is it truly a part of the cost of delivering the service? Not really. Because of this, many businesses put sales commission in Expenses. Either way you did it is okay by accounting standards and by the IRS. What is required is that you be consistent in how it’s reported. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Travel costs may be another area you’re wondering about. Travel costs are in Cost of Services because they are part of delivering the services by contract. Most real-life consulting companies make the client reimburse any and all travel costs. If travel is reimbursed dollar for dollar, it is handled as a non-revenue item in a separate account. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How come your employees’ wages show up in different categories? Because consultants’ wages are in Cost of Services only when they are working on a project. Their relative time as consultants, doing administrative tasks, and R&amp;D lets us know how efficiently we are using their time (which is the only source of the consulting company’s revenue). Not all service companies have R&amp;D, but for those that do, separating it allows you to keep track of how much capital investment goes into new products. This is helpful in determining how to price them. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Review your Income Statement again. Does anything concern you? What are potential problem areas? How would you improve this company’s profitability? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Remember we said earlier that time is the critical issue in a service company. You might question the wisdom of using the consultants for administrative tasks. Their salaries are much higher than Michael’s for performing these tasks. Lots of service companies get into financial difficulties when they end up having too much time when their services providers are not working directly for clients on “billable hours.” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What else haven’t we covered in this brief side trip? Certain types of expenses, for one. Interest expense, other expenses, and taxes would have to be subtracted to arrive at the true bottom line after taxes. You may wonder what “other expenses” mean. These are things like a loss or gain from selling a fixed asset (which we haven’t done). </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Well, we certainly haven’t exhausted a discussion about service businesses and how to treat them accounting-wise. But, hopefully, you know some of the things to keep in mind if you’re in a service business. Below is our Income Statement with the major categories used by typical service companies. </span></p>

<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You like having a second business. Maybe one day you’ll sell your lemonade stand and concentrate on being a consultant full-time. For now, though, you enjoy making a product and selling it. So, let’s leave the consulting world for a while and return to the best-tasting lemonade in the whole wide world! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">After all, week three is about to begin!</span></p>
</div>  <div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><div class="calibre1">
<p id="calibre_link-8" class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">CHAPTER 6</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743748525" src="images/000176.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">O</span>kay, we’re ready to start week number three. Stop and consider how much we’ve already learned about accounting! With all the knowledge we’ve gained so far, the coming week promises to be our best ever. Hmmm...maybe next summer, we’ll let someone else run the lemonade stand and we’ll promote ourselves to financial geniuses and become one of those big bucks consultants. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Certainly, dreaming of a glorious future is part of being in business. But, it’s Monday morning, and it’s time to return to reality. This summer we’re running a lemonade stand. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">At breakfast, you glance at the newspaper. The weather forecast promises a hot and sunny week. Great! But you don’t need the newspaper to tell you that there’s a clear, beautiful blue sky outside. Or that, thanks to the warm air, birds are chirping and singly loudly. Finishing your breakfast, you can practically feel the grass, flowers, and leaves growing outside! Boy, it’s great being alive! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Yes, you’re definitely hot for another successful week in business! But, before we start, what do we need to do?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Roll up the earnings! (Move last week’s earnings into Retained Earnings.)</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Please do so now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">BEGINNING BALANCE SHEET&ndash;WEEK THREE</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743748505" src="images/000015.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, it’s a new Monday, and time to replenish your inventory of raw materials. Even though you still have 50 lemons and 5 pounds of sugar left over from last week, you think that more will be needed for this week’s sales. You get your bike out of the garage, jump on, and (checking for cars, of course) cruise down the street. You’re heading toward Pappy Parker’s neighborhood grocery store. You’re feeling like a seasoned and savvy entrepreneur. After all, you’ve worked really hard the past few weeks. As a reward, you promise yourself a bottle of juice, some doughnuts, and a candy bar for later. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But, when you reach the store, you’re in a shock. There would be no extra money for treats because the price of lemons has doubled to 40 cents a piece! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">This is an outrage! Someone should call the President! Or, at least, the governors of Florida and California, where the lemons come from.What’s going on here? Is someone trying to run you out of business? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You can’t make lemonade without lemons, though. You want 50 lemons, but you didn’t bring enough money to pay cash. You complain about the price to Pappy. He isn’t happy about the price increase, either. “I’m paying more, too. Apparently, a freak storm destroyed a lot of the lemon crop,” Pappy explains. “No one’s getting rich from the disaster.” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The explanation calms you some. “We lemon people must stick together&mdash;or, maybe, squeeze together in tough times,” you tell good ol’ Pappy. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">He nods. “Listen, I’ll be happy to sell you these lemons on account. Should I add $20.00 to what you have on credit?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Please,” you say with a nod. “Mr. Parker, you’re the nicest man in the whole world&mdash;except for my dad, of course&mdash;and my uncles and grandpas.” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Riding home, you feel happy that Pappy is such a nice person. You feel sorry for those lemon farmers who lost their crop. But, mostly, you feel sorry for yourself that the cost of lemons just doubled. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">When you get home, you do a new Balance Sheet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You ask yourself, what comes in? <span class="bold">Inventory.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Inventory for how much? <span class="bold">$20.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did you pay cash for it? <span class="bold">No. We charged it.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Demonstrate the transaction on the next Balance Sheet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Are we in balance? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What do we have to do? <span class="bold">Increase Accounts Payable.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Increase Accounts Payable by how much? <span class="bold">$20.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, are we in balance? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743748455" src="images/000054.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But, there’s something else. Look at Inventory. We now need a way to separate the 50 lemons @ 20 cents each from the 50 lemons @ 40 cents each. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay, so let’s take a look at our Inventory. Do we have lemons in Inventory at two different costs? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Right now, we have 100 lemons, and 50 of them cost 20 cents each and the other 50 cost 40 cents each. Can that happen in any business with inventory&mdash;you buy the same raw material but at different costs? <span class="bold">Yes. </span>The price of raw materials can shift without any notice. Which means that you could buy the same material but at any number of different costs. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You start to think, Hmmmmm. Soon, I’m going to make another batch of lemonade using 50 lemons. What will be the cost of the lemons? <span class="bold">Well, ah, either, you </span><span class="bold">know...some at, like you said, 20 cents and others at, well, 40 cents. Just please don’t </span><span class="bold">ask me which price lemons are going into the next batch!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">It can get confusing, can’t it? Well, the decision our business makes about how to value its inventory is what we will look at now. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Some enterprising entrepreneur once saw this issue and came up with a way for all businesses with inventory to be creative.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We’re going to first look at a method of valuing our inventory where the first lemons that come into the stand are the first lemons that go out. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">First in, first out. FIFO. What does this stand for?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Simply stated, it means that the first lemons that came in will be the first lemons that go out, or the first lemons that we sell. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Here’s another way to took at FIFO.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743748422" src="images/000091.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Pretend you are putting the lemons in a pipeline, in the order that you purchased them. So, which lemons are first in the pipeline? <span class="bold">The 20 cent ones. </span>And, which are the last in? <span class="bold">The 40 cent ones.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Good, so make up another batch of lemonade&mdash;remember our recipe? Five pounds of sugar + 50 lemons = 60 glasses. (For your information, sugar is 40 cents a pound.) You make this batch yourself, so there’s no labor charge. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">What is the COST OF PRODUCTION using FIFO:</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">$_________</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">_________</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, using FIFO, how much do the lemons cost? <span class="bold">Ten dollars.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You take the cost of the “first-in” lemons, which is 20<img alt="7248" src="images/000187.jpg" class="calibre3" /> per lemon&mdash;for a total of $10. Then add five pounds of sugar at 40<img alt="7248" src="images/000187.jpg" class="calibre3" />/lb., for a total of $2. Get these raw materials (lemons and sugar) and mix them up real good in your pitcher&mdash;because it’s time to sell some lemonade! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But, first, demonstrate these transactions on a new Balance Sheet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743748397" src="images/000128.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Maybe you’re feeling a bit challenged by all the important accounting concepts and practices you’re learning. But you’re doing great! Better yet, there are no challenges to selling your lemonade today! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">It’s hot and people are lined up at your lemonade stand. The word of mouth about your great tasting lemonade has spread&mdash;and there are lots of new customers in addition to your regular ones. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Say, kid,” a grownup wearing a suit says, “I’ll give you one hundred dollars for your secret recipe.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“No chance!” you say. “Where would Coca-Cola be if it sold its recipe years ago? Sorry, a hundred dollars is not enough.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Business is great all week long! You sell all the glasses for 50 cents each. Fifty glasses are sold for cash. Ten glasses are sold on account. Total sales = $30.00, $25.00 for Cash and $5.00 in Accounts Receivable. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Demonstrate the day’s transaction on the next Balance Sheet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743748379" src="images/000164.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s review what you just did.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">First, what goes out of our business? <span class="bold">Inventory.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much Inventory <span class="bold">$12.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What comes in? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay, so bring in the Cash. How much Cash? <span class="bold">$25.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And then what else comes in? <span class="bold">Accounts Receivable for $5.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Are we in balance yet? <span class="bold">No. The Assets are $92 and the right side equals $74.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We just made some more Profit, right?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What was the sale? <span class="bold">$30.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What did it cost us? <span class="bold">$12.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What are the Earnings Week to Date? <span class="bold">$18.00 </span>Add the earnings to the right side, to balance. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s go through this again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, on FIFO, which cost of lemons did we use. <span class="bold">The first ones.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What’s our cost of goods? <span class="bold">$12&mdash;$10 for lemons and $2 for sugar.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Which cost of lemons did we leave on the books? <span class="bold">The last lemons.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay, we used 20<img alt="7248" src="images/000187.jpg" class="calibre3" /> lemons and left the 40<img alt="7248" src="images/000187.jpg" class="calibre3" /> lemons on the books in inventory. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, we’re at the end of the week.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What we want to do is look at different ways of valuing Inventory. Since all we want to do is isolate the inventory, let’s avoid bringing in any expenses this week. Normally, in a business, would we have expenses every week? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Right now, though,we just want to look at different ways of valuing our inventory.Okay?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">To do this, let’s examine the week-end Balance Sheet and Income Statement. Here’s your latest Balance Sheet, filled out for your convenience. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">ACCRUAL FIFO BALAN CE SHEET</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743748302" src="images/000003.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Does the left side equal the right side? <span class="bold">It sure does.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Since this is the end of the week, this Balance Sheet is an Ending Balance Sheet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, fill out the Income Statement below.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">FIFO INCOME STATEMENT</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743748290" src="images/000039.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Sales were what? <span class="bold">$30.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Beginning Inventory? <span class="bold">$12.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Purchases? <span class="bold">$20.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Ending Inventory? <span class="bold">$20.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Total available for sale? <span class="bold">$32.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, our Cost of Goods Sold was what? <span class="bold">$12.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Which makes our Gross Profit what? <span class="bold">$18.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And, remember, we’re not going to show any Expenses&mdash;so that’s zero. Which means that our Net Profit is how much? <span class="bold">$18.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Does your Net Profit on the Income Statement match your Earnings Week to Date on the Balance Sheet? <span class="bold">It should. </span>If you got $18.00 on both, give yourself a pat on the back! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, this week on FIFO, which cost of lemons did we use? <span class="bold">Twenty cent lemons.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Which is the cost of the lemons left on the Balance Sheet? <span class="bold">Forty cent ones.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We said earlier that there were different systems to value our inventory. We just used FIFO to develop the week’s financial records. But, now, let’s go through the transactions a second time, using the other system to value our Inventory. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s redo the week. Instead of First In, First Out (FIFO), we will use the opposite method of valuing inventory, which is Last In, First Out (LIFO). </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Remember, we purchased 50 lemons on account. The price had just increased to forty cents a lemon. Let’s start from this transaction.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What comes in? <span class="bold">Inventory.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">For how much? <span class="bold">$20.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Do you pay cash? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, to make the balance sheet balance, you need to increase what? <span class="bold">Accounts </span><span class="bold">Payable.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">By how much? <span class="bold">$20.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Remember, this time we will have the same Balance Sheet as on page 83, but we’re using the LIFO system of valuing our Inventory.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743748212" src="images/000080.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We’re using the system where the last-in lemons will be the first lemons that go out&mdash;that we sell. The last lemons that come in will be the first lemons out. What is this method called? <span class="bold">LIFO. </span>Which means what? <span class="bold">Last in, first out.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The pipeline metaphor won’t work this time. Instead, let’s pretend we’re putting the lemons in a barrel.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743748201" src="images/000115.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Which lemons are on the bottom? <span class="bold">The 20 cent lemons. </span>And which are on the top? <span class="bold">The 40 cent lemons. </span>Yes, and the last ones in are the first ones out. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Good. Now, make up another batch of lemonade: 5 pounds of sugar plus 50 lemons (and 2 gallons of water) make 60 glasses of lemonade. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If we make up this batch of lemonade using the LIFO system, what is the cost of the lemons? <span class="bold">$20.00. </span>So, the lemons cost what? <span class="bold">$20.00. </span>Plus the sugar, which is how much? <span class="bold">$2.00</span>. So, what is the cost of production using LIFO? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">The Cost of Production using LIFO is </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">$_______</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We’ll need this in a moment, so let’s repeat it. What’s the cost of production using LIFO? <span class="bold">$22.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Demonstrate this on the next scorecard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743748167" src="images/000154.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Moving on, you have a great week and sell the entire batch of 60 glasses. Again, 50 glasses for cash and 10 on account.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What goes out of the business? <span class="bold">Inventory.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much inventory (using LIFO)? <span class="bold">$22.00. </span>Remember, on LIFO, the last lemons&mdash;or the expensive, higher priced lemons&mdash;are the ones that go out. The cheaper, lower priced lemons are left where? <span class="bold">In Ending Inventory.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much Cash comes in? <span class="bold">$25.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much comes in as Accounts Receivable? <span class="bold">$5.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s do a new Balance Sheet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743748142" src="images/000189.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Once again, there are no Expenses for the week.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, show these transaction on the LIFO Income Statement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">LIFO INCOME STATEMENT</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743748134" src="images/000031.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Sales were what? <span class="bold">$30.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Beginning Inventory? <span class="bold">$12.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Purchases? <span class="bold">$20.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Total available for sale? <span class="bold">$32.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Ending Inventory of what? <span class="bold">$10.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Cost of Goods Sold is what? <span class="bold">$22.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Wait a second! Twenty-two dollars in cost of goods sold? That’s expensive? Why was the COGS higher? <span class="bold">Because the last ones in were the more expensive ones.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Gross Profit is what? <span class="bold">$8.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">No Expenses this week, so that’s zero.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Thus, our Net Profit is what? <span class="bold">$8.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Wow! That’s low, compared to FIFO.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">On the LIFO method, what are the total Assets? <span class="bold">$82.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">On the LIFO method, what are the total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity? <span class="bold">$82.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Does the left side equal the right side? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay!We used two different Inventory valuation methods. Did we get different bottom lines? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What was our Net Profit with FIFO? <span class="bold">$18.00. </span>And what was our net profit with LIFO? <span class="bold">$8.00. </span>FIFO gives us a Net Profit that is what? <span class="bold">Higher. </span>Why was it higher with FIFO? <span class="bold">Because with FIFO, our Cost of Goods Sold was lower and Ending Inventory was higher.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Fill out the following table, to make comparisons between FIFO and LIFO.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">FIFO vs. LIFO&ndash;THE NUMBERS DO NOT LIE!</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743748055" src="images/000069.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What conclusions can we reach?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">FIFO IS LOW COG, HIGH ENDING </span><span class="bold">INVENTORY HIGH NET PROFIT.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">LIFO IS HIGH COG, LOW ENDING </span><span class="bold">INVENTORY LOW NET PROFIT.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Remember, we said that accounting could be creative. Here is another way that businesses can be creative by how they account for what happens to their inventory. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Which method would you prefer?<span class="bold">Well...it depends.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Yes, it depends.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What’s a good reason for using FIFO? <span class="bold">For one, it looks better on paper. FIFO gives </span><span class="bold">me a better bottom line!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Good thinking! But if you make more earnings, what will the government want from you? <span class="bold">More taxes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, why use LIFO? <span class="bold">Taxes. With lower earnings, our taxes will be lower, too. </span>Which method do you think is simpler to keep track of? <span class="bold">FIFO. </span>True, FIFO is easier. So, remember this, the only reason a business would choose LIFO is to SAVE TAXES! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What was that? I can’t hear you!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">The only reason a business would choose </span><span class="bold">LIFO is to SAVE TAXES!</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But, you may ask, is this always true?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">That’s a good question to look at.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What is happening to prices in this example that makes LIFO show lower profit and taxes? <span class="bold">Prices are rising. </span>True, companies and businesses with rising costs who want to pay less taxes would chose which method? <span class="bold">LIFO.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Suppose, though, prices are falling and you still want to save taxes. Which method should you pick? <span class="bold">FIFO.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What major industry has had falling prices over the past few years? <span class="bold">Electronics.</span> So, companies in those industries that want to save taxes would use what inventory valuation method? <span class="bold">FIFO.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The choice of FIFO or LIFO is an important one, which involves two criteria. What is your tax strategy? What direction are prices going in your industry? (Also, you wouldn’t look at pricing in the next couple years. You’d look at the trend over a twenty-five period and try to predict the future.) </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s look at the week’s numbers, to review the two different systems.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What are total Assets on FIFO? <span class="bold">$92.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And on LIFO? <span class="bold">$82.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What’s the difference between the two Balance Sheets? <span class="bold">$10.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Where on the left side of the two Balance Sheets does the difference show up&mdash;besides the total assets? <span class="bold">Inventory.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And where on the right side of the two balance sheets does the difference show up&mdash;besides the total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity? <span class="bold">Earnings.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How many lemons do you have left in ending Inventory using FIFO? <span class="bold">Fifty.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And how many lemons are left in ending Inventory using LIFO? <span class="bold">Fifty.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We’ve got 50 lemons either way! With both FIFO and LIFO, you have exactly the same thing out on your lemonade stand. If you compare the FIFO and LIFO Balance Sheets, you have the same cash ($59), receivables ($11), 50 lemons, and a $2 insurance policy. So, by looking at our lemonade stand, could you tell what method of valuing Inventory we’re using? <span class="bold">No. </span>No, it’s just on paper. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">LIFO and FIFO are ways of valuing inventory where? <span class="bold">Just on paper.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, maybe you’re thinking that LIFO would be a problem with a perishable product, like lemons. In other words, if you don’t use the old lemons, what happens to them? <span class="bold">They spoil.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s look at this situation. Here are two bowls of lemons.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743747934" src="images/000105.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The left bowl holds the lemons from our imaginary pipeline. In other words, the First-In lemons.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The right bowl holds the lemons from our imaginary barrel. In other words, the Last-In lemons.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">On FIFO, which lemons will we use? <span class="bold">The first-in lemons. </span>At what cost? <span class="bold">Twenty cents each.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">On LIFO, which lemons will we use? <span class="bold">The last-in lemons.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And what cost? <span class="bold">Forty cents each. </span>But now, think about this for a moment. If we actually use the last ones in, what will happen to the first (or old) lemons? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">They’ll spoil. Then rot. Then attract all sorts of disgusting mold and vermin. Then </span><span class="bold">the health department will show up...you get the idea!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Which lemons should we use on LIFO? <span class="bold">The first ones. </span>At what cost (be careful here!)? <span class="bold">Forty cents&ndash;remember the valuation is just on paper.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The point is, LIFO and FIFO are methods of valuing inventory. Are they methods of using inventory? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Which lemons will we always use? <span class="bold">The first ones. Otherwise, they will spoil and rot.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">LIFO is just creative accounting. You would always USE the older lemons first, but with LIFO you just PRETEND that you would use the new ones. Really, you are using the old lemons and the new price. As we learned earlier, this is just a creative way to save taxes. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You might be wondering if you can switch methods. The answer is yes and no.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let me explain, starting with switching from FIFO to LIFO. Most companies start on the simpler method, FIFO. You can switch from FIFO to LIFO, the first time on your own. And why would you want to do that? In an inflationary economy, in which costs are going up, you would save on taxes. Once you have made that first switch, though, you cannot make a second switch without permission from the IRS. (The IRS?! And your were worried about the health inspector?) </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">It’s rare that the IRS will grant permission for a business to make the second switch from LIFO back to FIFO. You must file for permission with the IRS Commissioner and that permission must be granted before you switch a second time. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If you switch from LIFO to FIFO, would you have to pay back the taxes that had been saved? <span class="bold">Yes, I’m afraid so.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">In reality, would the taxes ever catch up with you? To answer, let’s look at when they could catch up with us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">On LIFO, what is the book value of our 50 lemons? <span class="bold">$10.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But what would it cost us to buy 50 lemons now? <span class="bold">$20.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, suppose you sold the business. What would you sell the 50 lemons for? <span class="bold">$20.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Ah, so you would have $10 in earnings and owe what? <span class="bold">Taxes!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Suppose we sold the last 50 lemons, then our ending inventory is what? <span class="bold">Zero.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The taxes would catch up then. So, we can save the taxes due on the $10 difference as long as we always keep at least how many lemons? <span class="bold">Fifty.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">One last thing regarding FIFO versus LIFO. How would you know what method a company is using?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Well, there is a special section of a company’s financials that’s called footnotes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">In the footnotes, a company is required to reveal the method it uses to value its inventory. In the footnotes, a company can also disclose the difference between the FIFO and LIFO amounts, so that investors will know that assets are “understated” on LIFO. However, the government does not allow companies to show FIFO on financial statements and LIFO on tax reports. Unless a company wants to have some serious explaining to do, all external reporting has to be consistent. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay, but can you average the cost of inventory?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Yes. Many companies do use the average cost method. If your inventory can be specifically identified, like items with serial numbers, you can always value inventory by specific identification. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Before getting back to our lemonade business, let’s summarize the FIFO versus LIFO methods.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">FIFO and LIFO are ways to value inventory on what? <span class="bold">Paper.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The only reason anyone would use LIFO is to save what? <span class="bold">Taxes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Phew! That’s the end of another week. Time to give yourself a break before moving on. Put on some music and dance around. Go outside for some fresh air. Do some stretches. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Or, I know, pour yourself a refreshing glass of ice-cold lemonade!</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-9" class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">CHAPTER 7</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743747823" src="images/000143.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">L</span>ike we do at the start of every new week, what’s the first thing we do? <span class="bold">Roll up the </span><span class="bold">earnings from last week.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We’re going to stick with LIFO, by the way, for the rest of the book because we want to save taxes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">NOTE: In real life, LIFO records are difficult and expensive to maintain. Only companies with large amounts of inventory would adopt this method. Consult a good accountant when making this decision. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Enough of the legal warnings and mumbo-jumbo&mdash;let’s get rolling. Roll up the earnings from week three.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743747808" src="images/000177.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What’s our Retained Earnings? <span class="bold">Twenty-eight dollars. </span>And, given the new week, week four, what’s our Earnings Week to Date? <span class="bold">None, so far.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">First thing, though, you receive a phone call from one of your friends who bought some lemonade on account several weeks ago. He finally got his allowance and is ready to pay you five dollars. This is great! You collected on an account without having to call in the collection agency. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did we receive Cash? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So what do we have to do to demonstrate this?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Add $5 in cash and take away $5 in Accounts Receivable. Use the next Balance Sheet to demonstrate this transaction.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743747789" src="images/000017.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did we account for that Accounts Receivable as a sale a few weeks back? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did it show up on our Income Statement as a sale back then? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Are we going to account for it as a sale now? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">No, because we already accounted for it as a sale on our Income Statement when? <span class="bold">Two weeks ago.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">That’s because we are using the Accrual Method of accounting.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Is any part of this transaction going to show up on your Income Statement? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But, we did get in some cash, didn’t we? Would it be helpful to keep track of our cash as it flows in and out of the business? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We’re going to bring out our third financial statement. Why three?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Think it of this way. At least, how many legs does a stool need to be stable? <span class="bold">Three.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If we think of our financial record-keeping as a stool, the Balance Sheet is one leg. The Income Statement is another leg. So, we need another leg for our financial stool to become stable. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743747749" src="images/000057.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And we’ve been managing our business with an income statement and a balance sheet. Both of which are on what method? <span class="bold">The Accrual Method.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The third financial statement is the Cash Flow Statement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Here’s a Cash Statement. We’re going to build it line by line.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743747740" src="images/000092.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We’re going to go through it line by line and, at the end of the week, we’ll put the whole Cash Statement together.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Basically, the Cash Statement records only the cash that comes in and the cash that goes out in a given time period&mdash;in our case, each week. This bears repeating: </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">The Cash Statement records only the cash that comes in and the cash that goes out.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did we start this week with some cash? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much was the beginning cash? <span class="bold">$59.00. </span>Record that on the Beginning Cash line. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, did we collect five dollars on our account? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Record the cash that comes in and the cash that goes out. We’ll put in a plus if cash comes in and a minus if cash goes out. On what line of our Cash Statement would this $5 go? Well, it was a collection, right? So add plus $5 to Collections. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You can write A/R next to the $5 so you will know it was from collecting Accounts Receivable. Got that?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The Change in Cash line is where you will total all the pluses and minuses at the end of the week, based on all the detail line items above. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Given that you’re such an entrepreneur&mdash;and once an entrepreneur, always an entrepreneur&mdash;you decide to spruce up your place of business. A friend’s older brother has a great stand that he built a couple years ago when he had his own lemonade business. You decide to buy it. You negotiate a hard deal and get the stand for eight dollars. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Another friend’s family has a tiny patch of land they’re willing to sell you for your new location. It’s part of an enormous vacant lot that, while locating near the corner of a busy street, is years away from serious development. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="7658" src="images/000129.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You buy the lot and the new lemonade stand for $10 cash.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You expect the stand will last about 10 years without major repairs. In the initial sales contract, you specify that $8 of the purchase is for the stand and $2 is for the land. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">(There is a reason for separating these which we’ll discuss later.)</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How do we demonstrate that on our Balance Sheet? We’re going to put our brand new stand in a corner lot for $10.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What are we going to buy it with? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay. Ten dollars goes out. What comes in? <span class="bold">The new stand and lot.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Is the stand and lot something we have? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, where are we going to show it? Is it an Asset? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What are we going to call it? What does a business call something it has acquired which is property, plant, or equipment? <span class="bold">A Fixed Asset. </span>Why “fixed”? Because it’s things not normally intended for sale, which are used over and over again in the course of doing business. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Go ahead and do another Balance Sheet, reflecting this transaction.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743747673" src="images/000166.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Besides a building or land, what other Fixed Assets can you think of?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">______________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________________ ____________________________ </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Maybe you wrote down things like office furniture, business vehicles, computers, tools, fax machines, telephones, book shelves, refrigerator&mdash;things like that. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We just bought a Fixed Asset. Is it ours? <span class="bold">Yes. </span>How much? <span class="bold">$10.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Do you know what it’s called when you buy an asset and add it to the Balance Sheet? <span class="bold">Capitalizing the asset.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, does the purchase of the land or the stand show up on your Income Statement? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Can we take the stand and the land as an expense? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How come we can’t expense them? <span class="bold">Because it is a major purchase of significant </span><span class="bold">value with a long life.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What’s the rule here? Generally, the purchase of major items of significant value increase your assets and are added to the Balance Sheet, that is, capitalized. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">One more time?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">Generally, the purchase of major items of </span><span class="bold">significant value increase your assets and </span><span class="bold">are added to the Balance Sheet (capitalized).</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Deciding whether to capitalize or expense an item is a pretty important decision that has some general guidelines. We will look at a few examples, then clarify the guidelines. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We’ve just transferred cash into another kind of asset, and capitalized the asset. Do you see it?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did cash go out? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We made a what? <span class="bold">An investment.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Go back to your Cash Statement and put minus $10 on the Cash Statement, on which line? <span class="bold">Fixed Asset Investment.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You like the new lemonade stand, but your friend’s older brother didn’t have great taste in paint. (Unless you call brown, purple, and hot pink an appealing combination.) </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The stand needs a paint job&mdash;and fast! It’s present condition won’t exactly attract many customers, so you decide to paint it yourself in bright colors. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You know that the local hardware store often has odds and ends in its paint department that are priced way down. You call and, sure enough, you can get a couple cans of paint for two dollars. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The paint dealer is a bit odd. He works at a hardware store, but he wears a French beret, a long white smock, and will only answer to the name, “Monsieur Claude.” You say, “Bon jour, Monsieur Claude. Here’s $2 for two cans. Merci!” One can is bright yellow. The other is a pretty shade of blue. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You go back and paint your stand. To your eyes, it’s a masterpiece. Right up there with the Mona Lisa!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How are we going to account for this paint?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did cash go out? <span class="bold">Yep, you put that $2 in paint all over the stand.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">On which of our three financial statements do we record this transaction? <span class="bold">We’ll </span><span class="bold">get to this in a few moments.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Before we do, let’s stop and consider whether we should take the paint as an improvement and capitalize it&mdash;or expense it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Do we want to add the paint to the Fixed Assets and, as a result, capitalize it? Does it increase the value of the stand?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Do we expense it?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Do you think we could do either?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Well, in fact, you could do either. If it is Super-Sticky, Weather-Bester Paint and lasts 10 years, we would do what? <span class="bold">Capitalize it.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Suppose it’s the cheap stuff that peels the first year. What should we do? <span class="bold">Expense </span><span class="bold">it. </span>Say, it’s the cheap stuff&mdash;would you have to paint that stand every year? <span class="bold">Yes. </span>Would that be an on-going cost of doing business? <span class="bold">Yes. </span>A maintenance expense? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Guess which paint we got for our hard-earned money? <span class="bold">The cheap stuff.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay, then. We take it as an expense which means we’re going to have to do what? <span class="bold">Reduce earnings.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Complete a new Balance Sheet that reflects the expensing of the paint.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743747547" src="images/000004.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">This might throw you into an interesting dilemma when you go to reduce earnings by $2. How much do you have in Earnings Week to Date? <span class="bold">ZERO, ZIP, ZILCH! </span>You could be tempted to subtract $2 from Retained Earnings&mdash;but those are past earnings and we do not want to change the past. In accounting, you are always working in the present or current accounting period. That means our earnings in this period are now minus $2. This is what is commonly referred to in business as being in the “red.” You might want to get a red marker to write this in, or put the amount in brackets to signify the loss. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How did this happen? How did such a thriving, promising, expanding lemonade business suddenly plunge into the “red”? The explanation is simple. You’ve been so busy making improvements, buying fixed assets, scheming and dreaming, etc.&mdash;that you haven’t opened for business this week! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">For the Earnings Week to Date, we’re in the red! And by how much? <span class="bold">$2.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did we pay cash for the paint? Does it also show up on the Cash Statement we started earlier in this chapter? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did cash come in or go out? <span class="bold">Out.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Cash for the paint went out. It’s minus 2 in expenses paid on our Cash Statement. Go back and write that in.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s review. All three financial statements get used in this transaction.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">On the Balance Sheet, cash goes out and we expense it, which reduces earnings. It gets recorded on our Income Statement as paint expense for $2. And it also gets recorded on the Cash Statement as minus $2 under expenses paid. Okay? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Gee, the new lemonade stand looks great. It’s really solid and the shingle roof adds character. The color scheme is great, too. Which makes you wish you could add one more thing before really, really starting to sell some lemonade this week. It would make your life so much easier if you just had a sink. With a sink you could wash and re-use glasses on the spot, instead of having to cart them home every night. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You make a few calls. New sinks are very expensive. But you find a place that sells used stuff that has a decent sink for only $2. Better still, because the owner doesn’t live that far away, he’ll deliver the sink for free on his way home! And, even better still, the owner is happy to let you charge the sink. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The owner brings the sink over, as promised, and stays to help you hitch it on to your lemonade stand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How do we demonstrate this transaction? <span class="bold">Accounts Payable goes up.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">By how much? <span class="bold">$2.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Will we have to replace the sink every year? <span class="bold">No. </span>Does it improve the stand? <span class="bold">Yes.</span> Being an improvement, how do we account for it? <span class="bold">Capitalize it.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, do we want to set up another Fixed Asset for the sink? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What will we do? <span class="bold">Add it to the stand.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We’re going to hitch that sink right on to our stand, aren’t we? <span class="bold">With a little help. yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Are we increasing the value of our stand? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">By how much? <span class="bold">$2.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Demonstrate these transaction on the next Balance Sheet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743747472" src="images/000044.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But wait a minute! Why are we not expensing the sink? We expensed the paint.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Here’s why. We said that we’ll be buying paint every year as an on-going cost of doing business. So it has a short life. But the sink will last for years. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If we were to sell that stand, would the sink increase the value of our stand? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If you add something that improves an asset, you capitalize it. So, if we increase the value of the stand we are making a capital improvement. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did cash get affected by buying the sink? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Why? <span class="bold">We charged it.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Does it show up on the Cash Statement? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Since we capitalized the asset, does that show up as an expense on the Income Statement? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">This transaction only shows up where? In which financial statement? <span class="bold">The Balance </span><span class="bold">Sheet.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You’re so busy, fixing the stand and climbing all over it that you crack a roof shingle. You want the stand to look perfect and figure it shouldn’t cost too much to replace a single shingle. You ask your friend’s brother and he says he’ll repair it for one dollar. He even allows you to charge it. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Is the repair an expense? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">For how much? <span class="bold">$1.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did you pay cash for it? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You charged it, right?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How do we demonstrate it?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743747420" src="images/000081.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Add $1 to Accounts Payable and go in the red by another $1.00.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did we stay in balance? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, did this transaction only affect the right side of the Balance Sheet? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Is that okay? <span class="bold">Yes. As long as both sides still balance.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What would make the roof repair a capital improvement? <span class="bold">You’d have to add a whole </span><span class="bold">new roof.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did we just return the roof to the way it originally was? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, is this another on-going cost of doing business? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">A maintenance expense? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Does this show up on our Income Statement? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did cash go out? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Since no cash went out, was the Cash Statement affected in any way? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The last four transactions involved the decision to capitalize or expense an item. Let’s take the time now to review.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How does a business decide whether to expense or capitalize an item? There are two main criteria for the decision. What are they? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">1. Time. How long the item lasts. You capitalize something that lasts longer than one year. Conversely, if it lasts less than a year you would expense it. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">2. Cost. If you buy a trash can and it lasts longer than a year, would you capitalize it? <span class="bold">No. </span>Why not? <span class="bold">It’s too insignificant of an item.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The second criteria is how much it costs. Most companies have a set dollar amount. What are examples? $500, $1000, $1500. So, let’s pick $500&mdash;if your company’s policy is $500 and the item is less than $500 we automatically expense it. If it is $500 and above we capitalize it. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Well, it’s finally, <span class="italic">finally </span>time to open for business. But, given all that has happened and the time it has taken, you forget to make time to buy some lemons and sugar and make more lemonade. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Oh, my gosh! Now what?!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Although it stands for everything you oppose, and you hope your customers understand that this one time they won’t be tasting your homemade-from-a-secret-recipe, world’s-greatest-tasting lemonade&mdash;you purchase some pre-made lemonade for $20 in cash. The carton says it contains a hundred glasses. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What do you think of this&mdash;is it a good idea? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Why not? <span class="bold">Freshness and uniqueness of product are going down.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But check this out. What kind of pre-made is it? <span class="bold">Truman’s Own.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Will the kids buy it? <span class="bold">You bet!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How did we pay for it? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much cash? <span class="bold">$20.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s demonstrate on the Balance Sheet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743747320" src="images/000117.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Are we in balance? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did cash go out? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What we did was make a cash purchase. Record that on your Cash Statement under Inventory Period. To make life easier, here’s a fresh Cash Statement below. Transfer all of the previous cash transactions in this chapter. Then, record the purchase of the pre-made lemonade. What happened? <span class="bold">Cash went down by $20.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743747305" src="images/000155.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Does the purchase of pre-made lemonade show up on our Income Statement? <span class="bold">Yes, under the purchases section of Cost of Goods Sold for $20.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, we’ve got this pre-made lemonade and guess what? Sales are great! You sell all the pre-made lemonade for $50. Forty dollars in cash and $10 on account. Other inventory remains the same. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What goes out? <span class="bold">Lemonade.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We’ve still got the old lemons. Although they’re starting to look a little, well...old.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What comes in? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much cash? <span class="bold">$40.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And how much on account? <span class="bold">$10.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Update the left side of the Balance Sheet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743747276" src="images/000190.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Are we in balance? <span class="bold">Not yet.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, we need to reflect what? <span class="bold">Earnings week to date.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Our sales were $50&mdash;and how much did it cost us in Inventory? <span class="bold">$20.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, what are total earnings this week? <span class="bold">$30.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But what are the earnings on the Balance Sheet, before reflecting the day’s sales? <span class="bold">Minus $3.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So $30 minus $3 equals how much? <span class="bold">$27.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay, update the right side of the Balance Sheet above.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, are we in balance? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, let’s go back for a minute to the last Cash Statement on the previous page.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did cash get affected? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We collected $40. Record +40 on the Collections line.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now that we finally had some sales&mdash;and, more importantly, some cash came in, we want to keep our good relationship with Pappy Parker, our grocer. Our original account with the kind old gent is almost 30 days&mdash;or close to overdue. So, we decide to pay $4.00 on our account for sugar. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We get on our bike and go down to the grocery store. “How’s the lemonade business?” Pappy asks. If he’s worried about getting paid he’s not showing it. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Today, things are definitely looking up,” you say. “So I want to pay you $4.00, in cash.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Pappy happily takes four dollars. In return, he gives you a free cookie. Doing business with some people is such fun!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay, you pay the grocer with what? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, what comes out? <span class="bold">Cash, for $4.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Do the Balance Sheet below.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743747217" src="images/000032.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What gets reduced on the right side, to be balanced? <span class="bold">Accounts Payable, BY $4.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now that $4 for sugar&mdash;has that shown up on our Income Statement before? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Will it show up on the Income Statement this week? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">When did we account for that as a purchase? <span class="bold">When it happened in Week 2.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Right, on the Accrual Method we accounted for it then even though we didn’t pay any what? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Here it is, two weeks later and we’re paying back in what? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Do the Accounts Payable show up as part of cost of goods sold this week on our Income Statement? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Nothing happens on the Income Statement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But did cash get affected? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Cash goes down by how much? <span class="bold">$4.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We’ll put a minus 4 right by Inventory Paid&mdash;and note that we paid Pappy the grocer back. Please update the Cash Statement on page 109. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Having paid Pappy some, you figure why not spread your good fortune around. You decide to pay back the bank $25 for loan, plus $2 for interest. The banker happily takes $27 from you. On the way out, the bank guard smiles at you and says, “Come back again soon. Hear?” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much goes out? <span class="bold">$27.00. </span>Right, $25 on the principal&mdash;and $2 in what? <span class="bold">Interest.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, how much Cash goes out? <span class="bold">$27.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Show this transaction on the next Balance Sheet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743747158" src="images/000070.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Are we in balance yet? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What do we need to do on the right side? We need to take off what? <span class="bold">Notes </span><span class="bold">Payable by $25. </span>Are we in balance now? <span class="bold">Not yet.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We also need to account for paying the interest expense, on the right side. So, what comes out of earnings?<span class="bold">$2.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, complete the right side of the Balance Sheet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Are you in balance now? <span class="bold">Yes. The totals should be $81.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">That $2 is an interest expense. Our cost of doing business with the bank.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Does any of the transaction regarding the loan pay back show up on the Income Statement? <span class="bold">Yes, interest.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Interest expense for how much? <span class="bold">$2.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Is the Cash Statement affected? <span class="bold">Yes, because cash went out.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, $27 went out. We didn’t borrow, but we paid back the bank $25 for what? <span class="bold">The principal.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, on the next Cash Statement, record the pay back&mdash;$25 of the principal on borrow/payback (Bring forward the numbers from page 109.) </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">In addition, put minus $2 on the Expenses Paid line.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743747111" src="images/000106.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay. We want to introduce one more thing before closing out this week. It’s how to treat the value of fixed assets over time. This concept is called “depreciation.” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What is depreciation? It’s the decrease in value of fixed assets over time due to wear and tear and obsolescence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s look at our major fixed assets, the stand, the lot it sits on, and the sink we added to the stand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We bought the stand for $8 and the land for $2.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What did we add to the stand that was capitalized? <span class="bold">The sink.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The building and sink are now $10 and the land is $2.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Why separate the land? <span class="bold">By law, you can’t depreciate land.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Why not? Give some reasons why you think we can’t depreciate land.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How long does land last? <span class="bold">Forever.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Does land wear out? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Therefore, can we depreciate land? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But, can we depreciate the stand?<span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And the sink?<span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Can we depreciate the stand and improvement? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How long did we say the stand is going to last? <span class="bold">Ten years.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And we can depreciate how much? <span class="bold">$10.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The method of depreciation we’re going to use is called Straight Line Depreciation. The way that straight line depreciation works is that you draw a straight line between the number of years (10 years) and the dollar amount...what did it cost you? <span class="bold">$10.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743747050" src="images/000144.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Using straight line depreciation, each year represents an equal percentage, how much is each year worth of the total depreciation? <span class="bold">10 percent if it is a ten-year life.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Therefore, if the total amount we can depreciate is $10 and the length of time is ten years, we can take $1 per year. If we take $1 for the first few years, it’s going to lower the value of our fixed asset by that amount. Which means that our $12.00 fixed asset is now worth $11.00. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Does that mean it’s really worth $11? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">It’s now worth $11 on paper. That’s called the net book value. When you hear the net book value of a fixed asset, it means purchase price minus depreciation. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We will show this on our Balance Sheet using <span class="bold">red </span>(negative) for the depreciation. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">On paper, the value is going down. In reality, though, out in the world, the value might be going up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, on our Balance Sheet, if we reduce the value of the fixed asset by one dollar, are we in balance? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What is depreciation? <span class="bold">An expense. </span>And expenses reduce what? <span class="bold">Earnings.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So what do you have to do here? <span class="bold">Reduce earnings by $1.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Show the depreciation transactions on the next Balance Sheet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743747012" src="images/000178.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did depreciation affect our Cash? <span class="bold">No. </span>Right, it’s the first time we’ve had an expense that didn’t affect our Cash position at all. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But, we get to take it as a what? <span class="bold">An expense.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Turning to our Income Statement, where would we write this down? <span class="bold">As Depreciation Expense.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, here’s another accounting rule for us to lock into our memory forever:</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Remember: Depreciation is a non-cash expense.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Like our other rules, this bears repeating.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743746990" src="images/000018.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">This is different from the insurance policy. When we took the prepaid expenses for the first year’s insurance we used up $1. Could we get the whole $3 back for it? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If we sold the stand and the sink, could we get $10 back for it? <span class="bold">Maybe. Maybe </span><span class="bold">even more.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So depreciation is a non-cash expense and it’s happening where? <span class="bold">On the Balance </span><span class="bold">Sheet, on PAPER.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, the government is saying you paid $10 for the sink and the stand, but we won’t let you expense the whole amount when you buy it; you have to capitalize it. But it’s going to start wearing out, in theory. So, we’ll let you take $1 as a non-cash expense. As a result, each year we would simply reduce the book value of the asset by the depreciation amount which obviously does not affect cash. This is why it is a non-cash expense. The advantage is that it reduces earnings and taxes without reducing cash. <span class="bold">(Pretty nifty, huh?)</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Here is your final Balance Sheet for this week. Please complete it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">ENDING BALANCE SHEET FOR WEEK FOUR</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743746961" src="images/000058.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, complete the cash statement below.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743746958" src="images/000093.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much did we collect? <span class="bold">$45.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And how much did we spend? <span class="bold">$63.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, +$45 and -$63. What is the change is cash? <span class="bold">-$18.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, before you go on, let’s look at this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If this says that our cash changed by -$18, then it went down by $18.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If we started with $59, what should be our ending cash? <span class="bold">$41.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, that means we started the week with $59 and ended the week with how much?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">$41.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Look on your last Balance Sheet. How much Cash do we have? <span class="bold">$41.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And, this Cash Statement tells you exactly where your cash went. So, it’s a recording of your cash transactions and how much came in and how much went out. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Wow! You’re doing great! In the matter of a few chapters, you’ve learned so much accounting&mdash;including the three financial statements and how to use them! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Well done!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, complete this week’s Income Statement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Because you’re working so hard and having fun doing it, we’re going to list the week’s transactions, so you don’t have to go back and find every last one. <span class="bold">You’re welcome!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">TRANSACTIONS:</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">You collect $5 cash from some of your friends.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">You buy a lot and a new lemonade stand </span><span class="bold">for $10 cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">You pay $2 cash for paint and apply it to </span><span class="bold">the stand.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">You buy a sink for $2 and charge it.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">You repair the roof for $1 and charge it.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">You pay $20 cash for pre-made lemonade.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Sales are good. You sell all the pre-made </span><span class="bold">lemonade for $50&mdash;$40 cash and $10 on </span><span class="bold">Account.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">You pay back your accounts payable for </span><span class="bold">sugar for $4.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">You pay back the loan for $25 plus $2 in </span><span class="bold">interest.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">You depreciate the building and improvements ($10 </span><span class="bold">total) using straight line depreciation. Show </span><span class="bold">this year’s depreciation expense for $1.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Ph-eww! What a week! While I catch my breath, go ahead and complete this week’s Income Statement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743746863" src="images/000130.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s check the Income Statement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Sales were $50.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Beginning Inventory was $10.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Purchases were $20.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, Total Available for Sale was $30.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The Ending Inventory was $10.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Which means the Cost of Goods Sold was $20.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Leaving you with a Gross Profit of $30.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The Expenses were: Paint, $2; roof repair, $1; Interest, $2; Depreciation, $1. For a Total Expenses of $6.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Leaving you with a Net Profit of<span class="bold">...drum roll please...$24!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Well, that completes another week. Next, we round third base and head for home!</span></p>
</div>  <div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><div class="calibre1">
<p id="calibre_link-10" class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre6"><span class="bold">CHAPTER 8</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743746834" src="images/000167.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">T</span>he summer is moving right along. August is approaching, when your family takes its annual vacation. There’s only a week or two before the vacation, and after that school starts. Which means you only have a brief time left to operate your lemonade stand and learn more about accounting. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">It’s Monday, and you’re about to start a new week: week five. What’s the first thing you do? <span class="bold">Roll up the earnings from the last week.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Go ahead and do that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743746822" src="images/000005.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay, with last week now officially behind us, it’s time to tackle a new week’s challenges.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The first challenge isn’t long in coming. Business is slow and, at first, you can’t figure out why. The weather’s nice and warm. Certainly everyone seems to like your new stand. No one seems to have minded that your lemonade is no longer made from scratch. What gives? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">A friend rides by on her bike. You yell at her to stop for some lemonade. She yells back, “I can’t right now. My sister’s playing in the all-city softball tournament at the park. If I don’t get there early I won’t find a seat&mdash;because everyone’s going to be there!” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Ah-ha!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">A lot of potential customers are gathered at the softball fields at the park. But your stand is nailed to the ground here! If only you could find a way to get your great-tasting lemonade to this mass of customers.... </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Ah-ha!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You should get a mobile lemonade stand! One you can take to where crowds are. Because if you can’t get your customers to come to where your business is located, then a smart businessperson goes to where the customers are! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You look in the phone book and make a lot of calls. Finally, you find a company which sells mobile refreshment stands, but they’re thousands of dollars! Well, there’s no way you can afford one of those, so it’s time to get creative. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s see. You’re not old enough to have a driver’s license, so you don’t need anything with a motor. You don’t own a horse or mule, so you’ll likely have to pull this unit by yourself. It doesn’t have to be that big, you know&mdash;just big enough to carry your supplies. And it can’t cost too much. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Hmmmm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Then it hits you like a bolt from the blue! A wagon! Like the one you saw in the hardware store when you were there buying paint. Yes! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743746794" src="images/000045.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You get Dad to drive you to the hardware store. The lady who sells wagons is Monsieur Claude’s twin sister. She wears a red-checked flannel shirt, red suspenders, and tucks her wool pants into tall black boots. She has her long, gray hair in a ponytail tied with a red rubberband. Her name tag reads, “Wonderful Willa Wagner.” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743746787" src="images/000082.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“I’m interested in buying a wagon,” you tell her. “How much are they?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“We happen to be running a special on our very best model,” she tells you. “It’s built of the highest grade steel. Its paint is rust-resistant. The tires are puncture-proof. A wonderful example of old-world craftsmanship. It has an estimated life of ten years, and the cost is a mere $20.” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">This woman obviously knows her wagons! You immediately decide you want it, you need it&mdash;you buy it!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s demonstrate the purchase on the Balance Sheet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Do we have enough Cash to pay for it? <span class="bold">Yes. You take $20 </span><span class="bold">from Cash to buy the mobile unit.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Is the wagon another Asset? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What kind of Asset? <span class="bold">Fixed Asset.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much is it? <span class="bold">$20.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But do we want to simply throw the wagon in with our other fixed assets&mdash;the stand, lot, and sink? <span class="bold">No. </span>Why not? <span class="bold">Well...because...ah...help me!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s look at our other Fixed Assets, starting with our lemonade stand. Is it attached to the land? <span class="bold">Yes. </span>It’s like a building, right? <span class="bold">Right.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What about this wagon? Is it attached to the land? <span class="bold">No, it’s mobile.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Is the wagon like a building or plant? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">A Fixed Asset that’s movable is called what? <span class="bold">Equipment.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">A-ha! There are different types of Fixed Assets.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Many companies separate equipment from buildings on the Balance Sheet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, because the wagon is equipment, is that the only reason it’s set up as a separate fixed asset on the Balance Sheet? <span class="bold">No. </span>Can you think of another reason why? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">_______________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Well, another reason is, since it’s a different type of Fixed Asset, we can depreciate it differently.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s do the next Balance Sheet, reflecting the wagon purchase.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743746714" src="images/000118.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">It’s very late on Saturday afternoon when you start for the softball tournament. Not to worry&mdash;it’s an evening tournament and the first game gets underway in fifteen minutes. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You head out across the neighborhood to the game, feeling on top of the world. After all, you’ve just bought that shining red wagon and you’re going to the game to cash in on another great entrepreneurial idea. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">On the way, you go by Pappy’s grocery store to buy more Truman’s Own. But the store is closed! You don’t know what’s going on&mdash;then you remember Mr. Parker said he was closing early today so he could go to the game. You’re a little worried about Pappy’s store being closed because you need more inventory. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You decide to push on. Hey, there’s bound to be a store near the ball park.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Sure enough, a mere block from the field you see that you’re in luck! There is a store and it’s open. But, once inside, you realize it’s one of the warehouse type stores that sells only in bulk. You look at the price and you really feel sick. Because the price here is $30&mdash;ten dollars more than what you paid at Pappy’s for the same quantity. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Thirty dollars! Your heart sinks. What are you going to do? Because you only have $21 in the cigar box you brought along (Note cash on your last balance sheet.) </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Looks like we have a major, MAJOR problem. What are we going to do? What would you do?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What can we do? Go to Mom and Dad! Isn’t that what parents are for? It’s a good idea, but then you remember that Mom’s at her weekly aerobics class and Dad took the afternoon to hit some golf balls at the driving range. No way can you reach them! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now what?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Go to the bank and borrow some money. Is the bank open Saturday afternoons? <span class="bold">No, It closes at noon on Saturday.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Maybe you could float a check! OHHH! Would our banker like that? <span class="bold">No, and </span><span class="bold">neither would the police!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You’re desperate. This is the worst business situation since Coke tried to pull its old formula with a “new, improved” Coke! Since Ford rolled out the Edsel! Dang! You have this shiny, new mobile unit&mdash;but no lemonade to sell! What should you do?! </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Sell the mobile unit!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The game’s getting going any minute now. Are you going to have the time to sell the mobile unit and run to some other store for pre-made lemonade? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Besides, you need a place to put your lemonade.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What else might you do?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Put the squeeze on your friends who still owe you money! <span class="bold">The Accounts Receivable.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Maybe. But none of them are at the game.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Can you return the wagon and get your money back? <span class="bold">No Willa Wagner is at the </span><span class="bold">tournament, like everyone else.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You could always buy less lemonade, right?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Sure, if you had all night to find a store that was opened and sold the brand you wanted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay, you decide, I’ll go to the insurance agent and get back your money on the policy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But his office is closed, too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Desperate people try desperate measures. It’s not a proud moment...it’s not something you’ll tell your grandkids sixty years from now. You decide to use the old inventory. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But, for how long has it been hanging around? <span class="bold">Weeks and weeks by now. </span>So, can we use it? <span class="bold">Only if we want a visit from the health inspector and a possible lawsuit on </span><span class="bold">our hands.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay, what do a lot of start-up businesses do? <span class="bold">Sell stock and go public.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">At a softball tournament? These ideas have gone from bad to worse! Is there nothing we can try?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Finally, you ask some friends for advice. One of them says, “You’ve been bragging about all those retained earnings you’ve been rolling up all summer. Why don’t you just spend some of those?” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Ah, a true friend!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s try this one, you decide.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You rush back to the store and say to the first clerk you see, “I want to buy some Truman’s Own, pre-made lemonade.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Yes, we carry it,” the clerk says.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You are so happy and relieved that they have it that you feel like standing on your tiptoes and hugging the clerk.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“How much is it?” you ask, hoping you misread the high price.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Thirty dollars,” the clerk says. “We only sell it by the shrink-wrapped case.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Cool. I’ll take it,” you say.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“How will you pay?” the clerk then asks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Well, I would like to give you $21 in cash and $9 of my retained earnings.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Sorry,” the clerk says. “Cash only.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You lay out the $21 dollars.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“That’s not enough,” the clerk says. “Where’s the rest?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“I have $9 in retained earnings. My earnings are as good as cash!” you insist.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“What we take here is green&mdash;the real stuff,” the clerk says. “I see $21 in green. Are your earnings green?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Well, not exactly. They’re black&mdash;as in ‘in the black!’” you admit. “But won’t you take my retained earnings? Please. PLEASE! Please, please, please, with whipped cream and a cherry on top! People have always told me I could spend my earnings. The only difference is my cash is green and my earnings are black.” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Sorry, no,” the clerk says. With that, he smiles, shrugs, and walks away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, can you spend earnings? <span class="bold">No. You cannot spend earnings. </span>You can only spend what? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You’re more than a little bewildered by this experience. Well, you think, if I can’t spend my earnings, what good are they? And, by the way, if they aren’t cash, where are they? You resolve to figure that out later. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Meanwhile, you’re desperate! You’re only a few dollars short and no one will help you! Maybe you should steal the lemonade. Wow, steal it? Do we want to do that? <span class="bold">I don’t </span><span class="bold">think so.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Hey, Pappy Parker let you open an account. Maybe this nice looking clerk at the warehouse-type store will let you charge the lemonade. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You chase after him. You find him dusting shrink-wrapped cartons of toothpicks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“Okay,” you say, with as much confidence as you can muster. “I’d like to give you $21 cash and charge the balance. Will you do it?” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“I don’t know you, kid,” the clerk replies. “How do I know you will pay it back?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">“How about calling my personal grocer, Pappy Parker, across town? I’ve got credit with him and I’ve paid all my bills.” Then you remember, again, that Pappy’s at the tournament, like everyone else. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You beg with the clerk; you plead. You offer to leave your valuable polished rock that you always carry in your pocket for luck. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Finally, the clerk agrees to talk to the manager on your behalf. And, miracle of miracles, the manager agrees to let you open an account. He said something about knowing Pappy and that anyone who could get credit from Pappy is probably okay. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We give the clerk how much cash? <span class="bold">$21.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The clerk gives us how much lemonade? <span class="bold">$30.00</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Go ahead and demonstrate the transaction.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743746544" src="images/000156.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How do we balance it? <span class="bold">Add $9.00 to Accounts Payable.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Are we in balance? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s take a moment to look at our Balance Sheet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If someone showed you this Balance Sheet, what would you say about this business? Are we profitable? Do we have lots of assets? Pretty good for four weeks in the business. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Is there a problem? <span class="bold">You bet there is!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What about our cash position? <span class="bold">Don’t ask!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Come on, what is the problem? <span class="bold">No cash!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If we have rain and everybody goes home and doesn’t buy any lemonade, what’s going to happen? <span class="bold">No cash coming from sales.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We have lots of assets. We just don’t have lots of what? <span class="bold">Cash. To be blunt, we have </span><span class="bold">zero cash. Zip! Zilch! A big fat goose egg!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But our Balance Sheet says we have plenty of Retained Earnings. Aren’t they cash? Don’t we have them in the bank? We’ve been rolling up those earnings? Aren’t they in an account? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">That question is worth the whole summer’s business.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You’ve probably heard people say, “I’m going to go spend my earnings.” But what did we just discover? Merchants will not take earnings. You can only spend cash. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If earnings are not cash, where are your retained earnings? <span class="bold">Certainly not available </span><span class="bold">as cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, right now, those earnings are tied up where? <span class="bold">In assets, inventory, equipment.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, don’t forget because this is worth the whole summer:</span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">Earnings Are Not Cash!</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Remember, the left side of our scorecard is a reflection of what’s out at our stand. What we have in Cash, Inventory, etc. Look at the line items on the Balance Sheet. Find the line which represents our stand and sink. Our wagon. Our rotten lemons. Our insurance policy. The Receivables from friends. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And, the right side is a record on paper of who owns or who provided this stuff. The truth is, everything on the right side is just on paper. The Liabilities show us how much we owe other people and the Equity (including the Retained Earnings) simply shows us what portion of the assets are ours free and clear. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Was it a smart strategy to take out that much cash to buy the wagon? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Can a business that’s profitable get itself in trouble? <span class="bold">Absolutely.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Because what runs the business on a daily basis? Do profits? <span class="bold">No, cash runs the </span><span class="bold">business on a daily basis!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If you remember nothing else from this book, always remember this!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">ON A DAILY BASIS, CASH RUNS </span><span class="bold">THE BUSINESS, NOT PROFITS.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Are profits and cash the same thing? <span class="bold">No.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What’s the thing, the driving force, the blood of the business? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Again, what runs the business? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">In truth, the profit just tells you how much you earned. It lets you know that your sales have exceeded your costs. And, when you combine the profits with your original investment it just tells you what portion of your total assets belongs to you. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Can you run a business for a while without profits? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How long can you run a business without cash? <span class="bold">Not one day!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, if you were to look at a financial statement and it was typed out with dollar amounts and you saw $52 in retained earnings, you might conclude, “Gee, I must have $52 in a bank account somewhere.” Do we have any money in the bank? <span class="bold">No.</span> That is a really, really important distinction. Our stand has been successful and profitable. We have received a lot of Cash when we made those profits. But we have spent that Cash on Inventory, a building, an insurance policy, a wagon, etc. The Receivables tell us that some of those profits have not yet been turned into Cash because our customers still owe us. Making a profit is very important, but having profits do not mean you have Cash. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And, as fate would have it, it doesn’t rain. Everybody crowds around our mobile unit for some lemonade and guess what?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Sales are good! You sell all the pre-made lemonade for $50 cash. Your other Inventory remains the same. You breathe a sigh of relief. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s review what just happened.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What goes out? <span class="bold">Inventory for $30.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What comes in? <span class="bold">Cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much? <span class="bold">$50.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What are our earnings on that? <span class="bold">$20.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And on the Cash Statement, that’s what? <span class="bold">Collections.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Please complete your next Balance Sheet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743746394" src="images/000191.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Given that good weather, luck, and a little business savvy saved the day, you decide to pay yourself $4 salary in cash. Finally! It’s your fifth week in business and, after what you’ve been through, you think you deserve it. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What comes out? <span class="bold">$4.00 Cash. Salary to the owner is an expense.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Which will reduce earnings by how much? <span class="bold">$4.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Complete another Balance Sheet, recording this transaction.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743746380" src="images/000033.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now that you’re back on your feet, you can look down the road a little bit. As part of your financial planning, you realize that you have to depreciate the mobile unit&mdash;after all, you own it. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What method did we use when we depreciated the building? <span class="bold">Straight line depreciation. </span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">This is the only method you can use with a building. With equipment, though, you have a choice. You can use straight line or accelerated depreciation. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">For those of you who have done any depreciation of assets over the past few years, you probably recognize that the government often changes the formulas that you use to do depreciation. One formula is called 2x (2 “times”&mdash;or multiplied by 2) the straight line base (also called double declining balance). There’s another one called one and one-half times the declining balance. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">There was a method called ACRS (Accelerated Cost Recovery System). Then there was MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System). The government frequently changes the period of time you can depreciate an asset and the rate at which you can depreciate it. We’ve elected to use 2x the straight line base as the method we’re going to use for accelerated depreciation. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What did we say the life of our wagon will be? <span class="bold">Ten years.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What was the cost of the wagon? <span class="bold">$20.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If we’re going to depreciate using straight line, what happens? It is how much per year? <span class="bold">$2.00. </span>Straight line equals $2 per year. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We’re not using straight line, we’re using 2x straight line. What would our depreciation amount be in the first year? <span class="bold">$4.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If we took $4 off our mobile unit, how do we show that on a Balance Sheet? <span class="bold">Reduce the value of the Fixed Asset.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Show this transaction.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743746343" src="images/000071.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay, so our mobile unit is now valued at what? <span class="bold">$16.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We know now that depreciation is what? <span class="bold">An expense.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What do expenses do to earnings? <span class="bold">Reduce them. </span>In the case of depreciating the wagon, what will it do to our earnings? <span class="bold">Reduce them by $4.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Taking them down to what? <span class="bold">$12.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Will it show up on the cash statement? <span class="bold">No. Remember, depreciation is a non-cash </span><span class="bold">expense.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How about the income statement? <span class="bold">Yes. as an expense.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, the first year, instead of taking $2 we’re going to take $4.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The key word in the depreciation formula is the word “base.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743746308" src="images/000107.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What was the cost of the wagon&mdash;or its original base? <span class="bold">$20.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, we subtract $4 in year one, what’s the new base? <span class="bold">$16.00. </span>It’s still a ten-year property. What would be the straight line depreciation on a ten-year property with a $16 base? <span class="bold">$1.60. </span>That amount, times 2 = 3.20. So, your second year depreciation is 3.20. What’s the new base for year 3? <span class="bold">$12.80 (subtract 3.20 from 16). </span>The straight line depreciation for year three equals? <span class="bold">$1.28. </span>That amount, times 2 is $2.56. You see how it works. The next year is $2.04, etc. If we do a graph, it looks like this...$4, 3.20, 2.56, 2.04...you see it’s a curved line. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You’re taking a greater amount of the depreciation in the earlier years and taking less depreciation in the later years. Is that good? <span class="bold">Yes. </span>Another way to say that is you are saving current tax dollars versus future tax dollars. Why? <span class="bold">Because saving current dollars </span><span class="bold">is better than saving future dollars because </span><span class="bold">of inflation.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743746274" src="images/000145.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The government often lets you take accelerated depreciation for things that will need to be replaced early on due to wear and tear. It’s the government’s way to support businesses in buying and selling assets which stimulates the economy. Those are only some of the reasons for accelerated depreciation. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now we’re going to introduce one final concept that affects all companies&mdash;TAXES.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">For now, let’s just focus on this week’s profit. You now owe taxes to the government. Our profits this week are $12. The tax rate is 25 percent. With $12 in earnings taxed at 25 percent, what are the taxes? <span class="bold">$3.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Which reduces earnings to what? <span class="bold">$9.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Remember that we said that we owe the taxes, not that we paid them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, create a Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Statement for this week and include the tax liability. We have printed the Balance Sheet to more closely resemble an actual company balance sheet. See if you can complete it. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743746256" src="images/000179.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, and Prepaid Expenses are what are called “Current Assets.” Current Assets are those assets that will likely be converted to cash within one year. The total Current Assets are $74. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">When you don’t have the use of color to show Fixed Assets and depreciation, there are often three entries for Fixed Assets. “Gross Fixed Assets” is the total purchase price of all the fixed assets. “Accumulated Depreciation” represents the total depreciation taken to date on the assets. And the “Net Fixed Assets,” of course, is the difference&mdash;or what’s called the Net Book Value of the assets. One advantage of having all three numbers is the ease by which to compare the accumulated depreciation amount to the Gross Fixed Assets amount. This comparison lets us know that our company’s fixed assets are relatively new. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The Net Fixed Assets amount was for how much <span class="bold">$27.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And the total assets are? <span class="bold">$101.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The total liabilities, including $3 in Tax Liability is how much? <span class="bold">$35.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Total equity equals...? <span class="bold">$66.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Are we in balance? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"> Before we do the week’s Income Statement and Cash Statement, let’s review the transactions one more time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">TRANSACTIONS:</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">You purchase a mobile lemonade stand for $20 </span><span class="bold">cash. Estimated life of the mobile unit is 10 </span><span class="bold">years.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">You purchase some more pre-made lemonade, </span><span class="bold">and the price has increased to $30 cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">(But, remember, we only had $21 cash and put </span><span class="bold">$9 on account.)</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">You have sales of 100 glasses of lemonade @ </span><span class="bold">50<img alt="7248" src="images/000187.jpg" class="calibre3" /> /glass, for $50 cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">You decide to pay yourself a salary for $4 cash.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">You depreciate the mobile unit using accelerated </span><span class="bold">depreciation (2 x straight line base). Include </span><span class="bold">all of the first year’s depreciation.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">You pay 25% of net profit before taxes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743746190" src="images/000019.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay. Let’s review the Income Statement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Sales? <span class="bold">$50.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Beginning Inventory? <span class="bold">$10.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Purchases? <span class="bold">$30.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Total available for sale? <span class="bold">$40.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Ending Inventory? <span class="bold">$10. </span>Wow! We still got some old and by now highly suspect lemons on the Balance Sheet! We’re going to have to figure out what to do with these rotten lemons soon. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Cost of Goods Sold? <span class="bold">$30.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What’s the Gross Profit for the week? <span class="bold">$20.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Expenses? <span class="bold">Salary, $4.00; Depreciation, $4.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Total Expenses? <span class="bold">$8.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, our Net Profit before taxes? <span class="bold">$12.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What did Uncle Sam take? <span class="bold">$3.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Leaving us with a Net Profit After Taxes (NPAT) of...? <span class="bold">$9.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, fill out the week’s Cash Statement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743746134" src="images/000059.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What was the change in cash? <span class="bold">Plus five.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The Beginning Cash was $41, so you should have $46 in Ending Cash. Check to see if you do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Well, that completes another full week! You’re doing great!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">You’re really enjoying the lemonade business and learning about accounting. Which isn’t to say that now you’re not ready for a little break. You are, especially when you learn that the family is jumping in the car and heading to one of your favorite destinations. Which is (write the answer below). </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">____________________________________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Just remember to send us a postcard, okay?</span></p>
</div>  <div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><div class="calibre1">
<p id="calibre_link-11" class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold"><span class="bold">CHAPTER 9</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743746113" src="images/000094.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">W</span>ell, you and your family had the best time on your trip! You got to order fancy desserts and eat at the sort of restaurants that your parents never take you to when you’re home. You got to watch lots of television in hotel rooms. You saw all sorts of wild stuff and spent whatever money your parents gave you. You even spent your own hard-earned money, on something that you promised yourself you’d keep forever. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But now, you’re home. And&mdash;guess what?!&mdash;you have to go back to school in a couple of weeks. Summer’s almost over.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Time to shake out the mental cobwebs and get ready for reading, writing, and math!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">In fact, with school just around the corner, you decide to quit the lemonade business, at least for this summer. Yes, sad to say, it’s time to close up shop, pay our bills, and complete your final statements. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">For starters, let’s look at our last Balance Sheet from last week and correct it for taxes for the summer. Because would we owe taxes on all the earnings? <span class="bold">Yes. </span>Here’s that last Balance Sheet, for review. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743746097" src="images/000131.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Our pre-tax profit last week was $12 (add the $3 tax back into the $9 Earnings Week to Date) and the retained earnings were $52. Adding pre-tax profit and Retained Earnings, our total pretax earnings for the summer are $64. Figure 25 percent as our tax rate. So, our total tax liability is? <span class="bold">$16.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now do the new Balance Sheet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743746090" src="images/000168.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Are we going to leave those old and now very ugly lemons in the family refrigerator? <span class="bold">No way! Mom and Dad want those lemons gone&mdash;and soon!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We have another inventory system we have to look at. It’s called FISH. Which stands for, First In, Still Here. And in what condition? <span class="bold">Rotten, very rotten.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What do we need to do about those lemons? <span class="bold">Throw them out.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Right. But what do we need to do about those lemons, as far as accounting is concerned? <span class="bold">Write them off.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s get rid of those lemons. What goes off the left side of the Balance Sheet? <span class="bold">Inventory. </span>And what will that reduce on the right side? <span class="bold">Earnings.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Go ahead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743746062" src="images/000006.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Problem? If so, look at the tax liabilities as a likely source. Why? Would the $10 write off of inventory affect taxes? <span class="bold">Yes. </span>See if you can recalculate earnings and taxes (round off to the next dollar). </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743746056" src="images/000046.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, if necessary, make any corrections to the last Balance Sheet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Are we in balance now? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How are we going to write the inventory off on the Income Statement? You may say, “Expense them”&mdash;however, what’s our ending inventory now? <span class="bold">Zero.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Instead of expensing it, we are going to write it off...where? <span class="bold">Ending Inventory.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Reduce it to zero. We write it off in inventory because it’s the cost of our product or inventory.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">As a result, this week’s Income Statement would have higher Cost of Goods Sold and lower Gross Profit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Earlier, when we were doing our statements during these weeks, have we been a little creative about the value of our inventory? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Have our assets possibly been overstated? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did the lemons go bad? <span class="bold">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Do you know exactly when they went bad? <span class="bold">No, not exactly. </span>We really don’t know if it was the second, third, or fourth week. <span class="bold">True. </span>So, when should we have written them off? <span class="bold">Hard to say exactly.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What should have happened the moment the lemons went bad? <span class="bold">We should have </span><span class="bold">thrown them away and written off the loss then.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">All that time when we went to our banker without statements, what were we doing? <span class="bold">We were overstating or inflating the true value of our assets.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">By how much? <span class="bold">$10.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What else were we overstating? <span class="bold">Our Earnings.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Because we should have put what there for ending inventory? <span class="bold">Zero, a long time ago.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What happens if your inventory is widgets? Or nuts and bolts, or anything that is not perishable? And you want to know if it’s good or bad? If you went to the warehouse, what would you look for? <span class="bold">Dust. </span>And what else could you have on there? <span class="bold">Cobwebs, maybe.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If you’re planning to buy a company or loan money to a company and you’re going to go and look at inventory, what are you going to look for? <span class="bold">Cobwebs and dust.</span> And then, what are you going to know about that inventory? <span class="bold">It’s old.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And what else? It’s not selling very well!</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, let’s just say it’s your business, and you want to sell your business. And you’ve got this inventory, what are you going to do? <span class="bold">For starters, clean it.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Right, get the vacuum cleaner out. Move the inventory around the shelves to make sure you get all the dust off. You want it to look pristine. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What have we here? Have we another area where people are sometimes creative?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">When you go to your Balance Sheet, how do you find out how much cash is in the business? <span class="bold">You count it.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How do you find out about the Accounts Receivables? <span class="bold">You check the books or </span><span class="bold">call the customers up to see if they agree how much they owe.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Prepaid Insurance Policy? <span class="bold">Read the policy to see what the dates are.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The stand? <span class="bold">Go out and look at it.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Easy to determine if they’re still good or not, right? <span class="bold">Right.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Inventory, on the other hand, is the toughest part to determine when you’re buying or selling a business. This is where you need the most expertise and help, because lots of people get creative in how they present their inventory. If you’re ever in the position of buying or selling a business that involves inventory get an expert in to help determine its true value. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Mom’s always harping about keeping our room clean. Especially if you’re ever trying to sell the house. The same is true in business. So, let’s clean up our Balance Sheet. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How much do we owe our suppliers? <span class="bold">$32.00. </span>Let’s pay them. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">And let’s pay off our taxes of $14.00.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s collect the $16.00 dollars still due in receivables.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s also cancel the insurance policy and receive a $2 refund.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay. On the next Balance Sheet, demonstrate where we stand at the end of the summer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743745924" src="images/000083.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We still have our $5 original investment and $40 in earnings&mdash;for $45 in total equity. But we only have how much cash? <span class="bold">$18.00.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Again, you can see the lesson we learned earlier. You have $45 in Equity, but only $18 in Cash. And why is that? <span class="bold">Because $27 in Equity is tied up in the building and the </span><span class="bold">wagon.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Still, are we in good shape for next year? Or, should we liquidate the building and wagon? <span class="bold">It’s an option.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">It is an option. If you decide to stay in the lemonade business you are all set for next summer with your stand and wagon. Of course, the downside is you’ve only got $18 Cash&mdash;not that great. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If you decide to liquidate the building and wagon you need to find a buyer, which could be difficult. That’s why these two are last in the order of Assets. In general, Assets are organized on the Balance Sheet in descending order of Liquidity. (Liquidity means how quickly something can be converted to cash.) </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If you sell the Fixed Assets for more than book value, you have to recognize the “gain” as profit. If they are sold for less than book value, you recognize the “loss.” </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Okay, do a final, Income Statement for the whole summer. To do this you need to get information from the previous five week’s income statements. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743745899" src="images/000119.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So, is that the end of it? Is that the end of our lemonade business? Our plans to build a great commercial empire? <span class="bold">No, not quite.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Before we gear up for back to school, we need to do some analysis regarding what we accomplished this summer.</span></p>
</div>  <div class="mbp_pagebreak"></div><div class="calibre1">
<p id="calibre_link-12" class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre4"><span class="bold">CHAPTER 10</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743745890" src="images/000157.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">O</span>ver the summer, we learned a lot of accounting skills; no question. Now, let’s use the experience of running our own business and think about things on a slightly higher level. It’s one thing to be able to do something. It’s another thing to be able to understand the big lessons involved in doing something. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So far in this book, we’ve learned about the three financial statements&mdash;the Balance Sheet, the Income Statement, and the Cash Statement. We’ve learned how each is structured, its purpose and relationships to the other two. We’ve also learned how to separate Cost of Goods or Cost of Services from Expenses. We learned the Accrual versus Cash Method of accounting, service company accounting, capitalizing versus expensing, depreciation, and Cash versus Earnings. What bottom line have we focused on all book long? <span class="bold">Net Profit.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now that you know all you’ve learned so far, you may be wondering, how did my lemonade stand really do and how do I find out how I did? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s begin by asking you to review how the summer went and how you feel about your stand and its performance overall. Take a moment to reflect on this and write down your thoughts. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">___________________________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Is there anything you would have done differently?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">____________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Did you work hard? Did the business grow? Did you make money? What are the things you did and decisions you made at the lemonade stand that affected profit positively or negatively? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">__________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Many things happened that influenced profits. Compare this list to what you wrote. We hired our best friend to make advertising signs rather than do them ourselves. We decided to make our own lemonade. Later we hired our sister to make some of the lemonade&mdash;did we negotiate the right price for labor? We went on a vacation and had to sell some inventory at cost&mdash;would you have wanted to give up the vacation? We sold to some customers with questionable credit and got stiffed. We borrowed money and had to pay interest. We chose the LIFO method which gave the illusion of lower profits. We bought property that required maintenance and depreciation. We bought pre-made lemonade and paid more for it than it would have cost to make the lemonade ourselves. We decided to open a new business opportunity at the ball game. We had to pay more to buy lemonade at the grocer near the ballpark. We successfully negotiated credit to get the lemonade when our cash was low. We forgot to use some the lemons we bought and they spoiled. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">All of these decisions had a direct impact on our company’s profit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Could you have done better? Now that you look at all the above, do you feel any disappointment in your summer’s performance?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Here’s the real question. Whether you own your company or work as an employee for a company, do you make decisions that affect your company’s profits? Truly, does any person in an organization not have an affect on company profitability? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Does whether or not your company make a profit affect you personally? How?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">_______________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How often do you think about how your actions and decisions affect profits? Daily? Weekly? Monthly? Yearly? Never?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">_______________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What does it mean for a company to be making a profit? What are the benefits of profit?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">____________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What are decisions that have been made in your department or company that have affected profits?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">_______________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We’ve talked about profits throughout this book and you probably recognize by now that of the three financial statements, the Income Statement provides the clearest picture of profit. But in the last chapter, we said on a daily basis, cash runs the business, not profits. So which is more important&mdash;cash or profits? Cash runs the business and profit is the bottom line. Cash is not even mentioned on the Income Statement. Does all of this seem a little confusing? If it is, then great. Please let yourself live in this apparent paradox and feel its discomfort for awhile. Living in this paradox and resolving its seeming conflicts is a great part of the art and science of business leadership and success. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Part of the problem is that many of us do not understand what profit really is. We know from the last chapter what cash is. It is so tangible and measurable. Profit is also measurable, however it is not real&mdash;it’s just a theory. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">I bet that shakes up your brains a little. So how do I mean it’s not real?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Let’s take some examples from our lemonade stand. In Week Two we sold some lemonade and made a profit. It certainly was measurable and we recorded it in our financial statements. But then a customer who owed us $4 moved away from town (or went bankrupt) and $4 of our profits disappeared just like that. So even though you have profits today, tomorrow they can vanish. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">At the end of the summer we had $10 worth of old lemons that we let spoil. We had to throw them out and another $10 of our profits disappeared. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Imagine that the wagon didn’t work out, and we discontinued the idea of selling at the little league games. Businesses make mistakes all the time or stop a venture they’ve started. We would have had to write off the $20 for the wagon as another loss to profits unless we could have found a buyer for the wagon. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Profits are easily and clearly measurable so they can readily be used by businesses as an objective measure of efficiency, productivity, and innovation. Their vulnerability to being lost is certainly one reason business leaders want so much to enroll their employees in maximizing and preserving company profitability. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But many employees do not truly understand profits and certainly do not know measures they can use to guide decisions and behavior. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">To discover these, let’s go back to the Income Statement whose bottom line is Net Profit. What are the three other major items on the Income Statement that affect profits? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">_____________________________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Profits are not real because they only exist on paper. Go to any business and ask them to show you some profits. They can’t do it. They can show you assets &ndash; cash, inventory, fixed assets, etc. These assets increase or decrease when companies make profits or losses. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Sales, Cost of Goods/Services, and Expenses. Profit by definition is the amount by which your sales exceed your costs of providing the goods or services and to run the business. Your company’s sales measure how much your customers are willing to vote (with their cash) for your product or service. The two cost categories measure how motivated and effective the company’s employees are in making decisions and managing the operation. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">If you look at the three measures, how do you increase profits?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">____________________________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The obvious answer is to increase sales and decrease Cost of Goods/Services and Expenses. We all know that none of these is an absolute. We would not want to increase sales on a product that gives a very low profit margin or if we were unable to meet the increased production schedule. We might want to increase Costs of Goods and Expenses if we’re starting up a new line of production. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">So what do you measure and use to guide decisions if you work on a production line or in an administrative department?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">It certainly begins with Sales, COGS, and Expenses, but the raw numbers for these presents a problem. Look at the numbers for our summer at the lemonade stand and see if you can discover the problem in just using the raw numbers. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Since we artificially eliminated Expenses in week three, the chart below is going to compare weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5.</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743745818" src="images/000192.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The problem is that from period to period the numbers are not stable&mdash;they fluctuate. Fluctuations in these numbers occur for many reasons&mdash;seasonally (we sell more lemonade in summer than winter), normal business cycle, marketing campaigns, etc. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What can we do to give us better numbers to work with that take out the fluctuations?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">____</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">_____________________________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">______________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">We hope that your answer was to use comparisons or ratios. Regardless of whether the numbers are increasing or decreasing, we can get consistency by comparing Cost of Goods to Sales, Expenses to Sales, and Net Profit to Sales. Let’s look at these numbers for week 5. Sales were $50, Cost of Goods $30, Expenses $8, and Net Profit $12 (pre-tax). </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The three ratios are:</span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743745809" src="images/000034.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743745808" src="images/000072.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What do these mean? Out of every dollar in Sales, it costs us 60 cents for the goods for the sale, 16 cents to run the business, and we make 24 cents in Net Profit. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">But are these numbers good or bad? We need still more comparison. And what would we compare to?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">_________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">______________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">First, our competitors, and since different industries and different types of businesses have different ratios, it’s important that we compare ourselves to our true competitors. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How do we find out our competitors’ numbers, so we can do a competitive analysis? Should we simply call them up and ask for their ratios? <span class="bold">Not likely!</span>Well, this may take a little library or Internet research&mdash;because several companies keep a record of Industry Ratios and Norms. Dunn &amp; Bradstreet and Robert Morris &amp; Associates are two that keep key rations and industry norms. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Getting this information compares us to competitors, but who else did we say we want to compare to? <span class="bold">Ourselves.</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How are we to compare ourselves to ourselves? Let’s use a sports team, the Chicago Bulls, as an analogy. If they won last night, what does that tell us? Certainly, we may be happy they won (if we’re fans), but does that make them a good team all of the time? What if they lost last night? Does that make them a bad team? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The point is, looking at a single game doesn’t tell us much. What will tell us more? A season would tell us quite a bit more. But the best indicator of the whole organization would be several seasons&mdash;i.e., a trend. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">In business we would call this analysis a “trend analysis.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">In this book, we’ve taken the liberty of using weeks as our accounting period. In a real life, a trend analysis would use years. So, we’re going to use four weeks and pretend they are years, just to show you how it works. Since we had no expenses in week three, we will leave that week out and look at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">The trend analysis table will show us our Sales, Cost of Goods, Expenses, and Net Profit. It will also show our three ratios: COGS/Sales, Expenses/Sales, and Net Profit/Sales. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre2"><img alt="-1743745781" src="images/000108.jpg" class="calibre3" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, using our key ratios, review the trend analysis table and answer the following questions:</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">1. Did we make a profit? ________ 2. How is the Net Profit/Sales trending, up or down? _________ 3. If the Net Profit/Sales ratio is going down, is the problem reflected in the COGS/Sales ratio, the Expenses/Sales ratio, or both? ___________________ 4. What has been happening in the business that is causing the problem? </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">_________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">______________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">5. As a business leader, how would you resolve the problem?</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">_______________________________</span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Now, let’s review the questions. We did make a profit each week this summer. However, with a Net Profit/Sales ratio that went from 0.4 to 0.24, this ratio was going down, which is a problem. Looking at the two cost ratios, we see that although there was some fluctuation in the Expenses/Sales ratio, it was pretty steady over the four periods. The problem is in COGS/Sales which went from 0.4 to 0.6, a very dramatic increase. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">What has happened in the business to cause the problem? The easy answer is that the cost of lemonade was a lot higher at the grocer near the game than at your regular grocer’s. From the larger perspective, you made a rash and poorly planned decision to start a new venture. There was no plan to continue the stand which was making money, while starting the new venture at the game. Purchasing the equipment almost put you out of business and certainly had an indirect effect on profit. There was very poor planning about the purchase of new inventory and the cash shortage limited your options and negotiating power at the new grocery store. Finally, you failed to recognize that people pay a lot more for drinks at a game and did not raise your prices accordingly, which could have lessened the pain of your increased costs. It should now be fairly clear what you would do differently. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">How do you like being a consultant? You’re pretty darn smart, aren’t you? You should feel pretty happy to have the tools to analyze your and other company’s profit performance and the key questions that can lead to discovering how to improve it. You can now go back to the list of things that affected profit and prioritize the things you would change or do differently. </span></p>
<p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre5">Hey! We still need to complete <span class="italic">The Accounting Game. </span>To do so, please take the Post-Test. You’ll recognize it as the same as the Pre-Test you took at the start of this book. But we guarantee that your score will be a lot higher now! Take a few minutes and complete the test. When you’re done, you’ll find the answers at the end of this book. Score both the Pre- and Post-Test. Then congratulate yourself on how much you’ve learned! </span></p>
